    <h1 class="heading1">Boolean logic</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Named after the 19th-century mathematician George Boole, Boolean logic is a form of algebra in which all values are reduced to either TRUE or FALSE. Boolean logic is especially important for computer science because it fits nicely with the binary numbering system, in which each bit has a value of either 1 or 0 (<a href="http://www.webopedia.com">Webopedia</a>).</p>
