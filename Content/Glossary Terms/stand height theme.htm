    <h1 class="heading1">stand height theme</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">A raster theme in the Landscape File that is used for computing wind reduction to midflame height and spotting distances from torching trees. This value is neither that of the tallest tree nor an average height of all trees. A good estimate at stand height would be the average height of the dominant and co-dominant trees in a stand. Values (in WFDSS Landscapes) are in meters with a precision of the fire behavior calculations limited to the nearest 1/10th meter. </p>
