    <h1 class="heading1">tactical objective</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Statements of tactical direction for small, site-specific areas (e.g., divisions or branches). Tactical objectives may be limited to short time periods, such as a single operational period (&lt;24 hours), but can be extended for multiple operational periods. Tactical objectives can serve as a means for tracking incident accomplishments and workload demand thresholds.</p>
