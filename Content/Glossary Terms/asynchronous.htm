    <h1 class="heading1">asynchronous</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Not simultaneous or immediately interactive. In computer-mediated communication, asynchronous ususually means that different users accessing the same channel of communication (e-mail, newsgroups, etc.) can submit data independently of one another, so that other users do not have to wait until a submission is finished before submmitting data of their own, and users do not have to be connected to the network simultaneously. (<a href="http://www.peo.on.ca/PEO_Chapters/Glossary.htm">http://www.peo.on.ca/PEO_Chapters/Glossary.htm</a>)</p>
    <p class="bodytext">WFDSS uses asynchronous methods to process data and to communicate internally. This allows the application to respond more quickly and efficiently to user inputs and greatly improves user experience.</p>
