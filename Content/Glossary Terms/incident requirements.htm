    <h1 class="heading1">incident requirements</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Incident-specific directives, standards, specifications, or constraints that need to be complied with when implementing management actions on a specific fire incident. Incident requirements derive from the Land Management Requirements, legal authorities, or other local influences (e.g., county commissioners, air quality boards) that pertain to the incident or its associated actions; they often define the limitations or "sideboards" when implementing the course of action. </p>
