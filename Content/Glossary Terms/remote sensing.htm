    <h1 class="heading1">remote sensing</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Collecting and interpreting information about the environment and the surface of the earth from a distance, primarily by sensing radiation that is naturally emitted or reflected by the earth's surface or from the atmosphere, or by sensing signals transmitted from a device and reflected back to it. Examples of remote sensing methods include aerial photography, radar, and satellite imagery.
