    <h1 class="heading1">National Digital Forecast Database</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">National Weather Service (NWS) Forecast Data consists of 2.5 kilometer gridded forecasts of wind and weather data (e.g., cloud cover, maximum temperature, windspeed). The database contains a seamless mosaic of digital forecasts that have been validated by meteorologists at National Weather Service field offices.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Forecast data is used in WFDSS Basic, Short-Term, Near-Term and FSPRO Fire Behavior models. For consistency with current and historic data, the NWS Forecast weather and wind data are obtained from the forecast grid that is located over the RAWS used in the analysis.</p>
