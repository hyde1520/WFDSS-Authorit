    <h1 class="heading1">Strategic Objectives</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">The objectives set forth in an approved Land Management Plan, Resource Management Plan, Fire Management Plan or other guiding documents that provide the basis for land and resource management in a designated area; often referred to as <span class="emphasis">Desired Future Conditions</span>. These are broad statements that identify changes in water, soil, air or vegetation from the present to proposed conditions but can also describe an existing resource condition that should be maintained. Strategic objectives deal with large areas over long time periods and project intended outcomes of management activities that contribute to the maintenance or achievement of desired conditions.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">The term <span class="emphasis">Strategic Objective</span> is specific to WFDSS (Zimmerman 2001) although its definition mirrors that of<span class="emphasis"> Land Management Objective</span> as published in <span class="emphasis">Decision Making for Wildfire: A Guide for Applying a Risk Management Process at the Incident Level GTR-298</span>. Developed cooperatively by the S482 Steering Committee, Brett Fay (Fire Use Subcommittee), Dick Bahr (Policy), Jeff Manley (Interagency Fire Planning Committee), and Lisa Elenz (Wildland Fire Management RD&amp;A - WFDSS); the definition is currently utilized by the S482 course and has been submitted for inclusion in the NWCG Wildland Fire Glossary.</p>
