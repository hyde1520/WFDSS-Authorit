    <h1 class="heading1">WindNinja</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">A computer program that computes spatially varying wind fields (gridded winds) for wildland fire application. It requires elevation data for the modeling area, a domain-mean initial wind speed and direction, and specification of the dominate vegetation in the area. It can be downloaded from <a href="">firelab.org</a>.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">WFDSS Basic Fire Behavior and Short-Term Fire Behavior provide users with the option of using a version of WindNinja to generate gridded winds. Gridded winds are generated when the landscape is produced and the wind vectors are created at the same resolution as the landscape. For more information, see the <a href="https://www.firelab.org/project/windninja">Windninja</a> webpage.</p>
