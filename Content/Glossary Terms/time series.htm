    <h1 class="heading1">time series</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Quantities of data that represent or trace the values taken by a variable over a period of time such as a month, quarter, or year. Time series data occur whenever the same measurements are recorded on a regular basis. In WFDSS, time series is used by the FSPro fire simulation model and is an ordered sequence of values of a variable (ERC) that are equally spaced in time (1 day).</p>
    <p class="bodytext">A time series analysis is used to characterize the seasonal trend in ERC, autocorrelation of residuals, and daily standard deviation and stochastically generate artificial time series of afternoon fuel moisture. Time series modeling is capable of generating a large number of realistic weather scenarios needed for ensemble fire simulations (such as FSPro) and capturing the main influences of antecedent and future weather trends (FSPro:  Finney, M. A., Grenfell, I. C., McHugh, C. W.,Seli, R. C., Trethewey, D., Stratton, R. D., Brittain, S.
