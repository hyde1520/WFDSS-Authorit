    <p class="bodytext">The Incident Risk Console (RisC) is a dynamic, near-real time application that displays a concise, graphical (green/yellow/red) ranking of risk elements, for large and emerging wildland fire incidents in a ‘dashboard’ style overview. End-users (primarily national level federal fire managers) can conduct rapid comparisons of up to eight primary risk elements between fires and continue to 'drill down' to view incident specific details. RisC ingests data from fire reporting systems (ICS 209, ROSS, WFDSS) and filters out the 'noise' by displaying only pertinent information for conducting broad high level assessments of evolving wildland fire situations.</p>
