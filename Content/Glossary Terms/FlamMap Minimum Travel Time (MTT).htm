    <h1 class="heading1">FlamMap Minimum Travel Time (MTT)</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">A (PC-based) two-dimensional fire growth model that calculates fire growth and behavior by searching for the set of pathways with minimum spread times from a point, line, or polygon ignition source, keeping environmental (fuel moistures and winds) conditions constant for the duration of the simulation.  MTT is implemented in the stand-alone FlamMap. There is also a version in WFDSS (Short Term Fire Behavior).</p>
