    <p class="bodytext">Hourly Records are the weather records that are used by the WFDSS Basic, Short-Term and Near-Term fire behavior models.  Up to 24 hours of weather data is displayed for each day in the analyses conditioning and burn period.  Hourly Records are retrieved from RAWS for hours that occurred in the past and from a National Weather Service gridded forecast product for hours in the future. These records can be viewed in WFDSS by choosing a date in the weather summary table in the Analysis/Information Tab.  Hourly Record inputs include, precipitation amount (in hundredths), temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction, cloud cover (%) and record type (an indicator if the weather came from a RAWS observation or the forecast).</p>
