    <h1 class="heading1">building cluster points</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">A spatial data layer in WFDSS where GIS map points represent close proximity to assumed locations of structures. These points approximate the location of one or more structures. Most building cluster points represent the center of parcels where county assessor records indicate taxable improvements are present, but may also represent structure point locations identified by county officials. Building cluster points are intended for STRATEGIC USE ONLY. (NFDSC Economics Group)</p>
