    <h1 class="heading1">Short-Term Fire Behavior</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">A two-dimensional fire growth model. This web-based (mostly automated) application calculates spread rates and maximum spread direction at each cell. Using one set of wind and fuel moisture conditions, it provides potential fire spread (arrival times and major paths) for a user-defined length of time. STFB is essentially a web-based version of FlamMap's Minimum Travel Time (MTT) which is a desktop application.</p>
