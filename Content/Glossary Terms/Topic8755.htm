    <p class="bodytext">Basic Fire Behavior models fire behavior in the direction of maximum spread when the default "Direction from Max" is kept at 0. However, Fire Behavior Specialists can calculate outputs for backing and flanking fires by modifying the "Direction from Max," using any integer from 1-359. For example, to calculate fire behavior for a backing fire, the analyst would enter 180 and to calculate fire behavior for a flanking fire, would enter 90.</p>
