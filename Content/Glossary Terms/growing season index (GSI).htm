    <p class="bodytext">The Growing Season Index (GSI) is a meteorological data-based phenology model that is used to predict changes to live fuel moisture throughout the year. GSI live fuel calculations, based on the selected RAWS, are used in all WFDSS fire behavior models to populate the default woody and herbaceous fuel moisture inputs. As with any model input, Fire Behavior Analysts can change the calculated defaults and enter measured or observed values when better local data is available. See <a href="https://www.wfas.net/index.php/growing-season-index-experimental-products-96">GSI</a> for more information. </p>
