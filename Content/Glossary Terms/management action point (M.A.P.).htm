    <h1 class="heading1">management action point (M.A.P.)</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Clearly specified management conditions for an incident that, when reached, cause the implementation of a predefined modification to existing management actions, or trigger the deployment of new strategies and/or tactics. M.A.P.s are usually spatial, but can also be temporal or tied to conditions that cannot be conveyed geographically using points, lines, or polygon features.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">A zipped shapefile that contains point, line, or polygon features and can be created in WFDSS or uploaded from a GIS by an incident owner or editor. The shapefile depicts the spatial component of an M.A.P. if it has one.</p>
