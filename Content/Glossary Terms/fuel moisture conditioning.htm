    <h1 class="heading1">fuel moisture conditioning</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Allows dead fuel moisture values to be adjusted based on aspect, elevation, forest canopy cover, and previous weather.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Conditioning dead fuel moistures prior to doing a fire behavior analysis is very important. WFDSSfire behavior models do this conditioning automatically by retrieving RAWS observations for the 7 days prior to the analysis date. Fire Behavior Specialists can modify these data as needed by selecting a different RAWS station.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">The models (WFDSS BFB and STFB) calculate separate dead fuel moistures for each landscape cell based on the topography and shading from forest canopy cover and clouds, as well as the recorded weather (precipitation, high and low temperatures and high and low relative humidity values) for the previous 7 days. The dead fuel moistures that have been calculated by the start date and time of the analysis are what are used to determine the outputs in WFDSS fire behavior models. </p>
