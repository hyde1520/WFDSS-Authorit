    <h1 class="heading1">global positioning system (GPS)</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">A system of radio-emitting and -receiving satellites used for determining positions on the earth. The orbiting satellites transmit signals that allow a GPS receiver anywhere on earth to calculate its own location through trilateration. Developed and operated by the U.S. Department of Defense, the system is used in navigation, mapping, surveying, and other applications in which precise positioning is necessary (<a href="http://resources.arcgis.com/glossary">ESRI Dictionary</a>).</p>
