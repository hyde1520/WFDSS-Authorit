    <h1 class="heading1">desired condition</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">The composition and structural characteristics of the plant community on a site or ecological unit which meets land management plan or other management objectives (after FSH 2090.11); or those landscape conditions that are most conducive to ecosystem health based on long-term management objectives.  Desired conditions can be the same as existing conditions. Desired conditions may also refer to the state of a site or ecological unit in relation to a desired process, such as fire return interval, rather than to a specific vegetative structure or composition of the unit.</p>
