    <h1 class="heading1">layer</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">[data structures] The visual representation of a geographic dataset in any digital map environment. Conceptually, a layer is a slice or stratum of the geographic reality in a particular area, and is more or less equivalent to a legend item on a paper map. On a road map, for example, roads, national parks, political boundaries, and rivers might be considered different layers.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">[ESRI software] In ArcGIS, a reference to a data source, such as a shapefile, coverage, geodatabase feature class, or raster, that defines how the data should be symbolized on a map. Layers can also define additional properties, such as which features from the data source are included. Layers can be stored in map documents (.mxd) or saved individually as layer files (.lyr). Layers are conceptually similar to themes in ArcView 3.x.(<a href="http://resources.arcgis.com/glossary">ESRI Dictionary</a>)</p>
