    <h1 class="heading1">National Geospatial Data Clearinghouse (NGDC)</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">A distributed network of geospatial data producers, managers, and users linked electronically. Building on initiatives, such as the national information infrastructure, the clearinghouse uses a distributed, electronically connected network, such as the Internet. Each data provider describes available data in an electronic form, and provide these descriptions (or "metadata") using means that can be accessed over a communications network. Thus, the data for the clearinghouse are located at the sites of data producers (or, where more efficient, at the sites of intermediaries) throughout the country. Using the network, users will search these descriptions to locate data that are suitable for their applications. (<a href="http://www.fgdc.gov/metadata/csdgm/glossary.html">FGDC-STD-001-1998</a>)</p>
