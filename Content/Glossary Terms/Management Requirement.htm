    <h1 class="heading1">Management Requirement</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">The requirements set forth in an approved Land Management Plan, Resource Management Plan, Fire Management Plan or other guiding documents that provide the basis for land and resource management in a designated area. Requirements are directives, standards, specifications or constraints that must be complied with when implementing management actions.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">The term <span class="emphasis">Management Requirement</span> is specific to WFDSS although its definition mirrors that of<span class="emphasis"> Land Management Requirement</span> as published in <span class="emphasis">Decision Making for Wildfire: A Guide for Applying a Risk Management Process at the Incident Level</span><span class="emphasis">GTR-298</span>. Developed cooperatively by the S482 Steering Committee, Brett Fay (Fire Use Subcommittee), Dick Bahr (Policy), Jeff Manley (Interagency Fire Planning Committee), and Lisa Elenz (Wildland Fire Management RD&amp;A - WFDSS); the definition is currently utilized by the S482 course and has been submitted for inclusion in the <a href="http://www.nwcg.gov/glossary-of-wildland-fire-terminology">NWCG Wildland Fire Glossary</a>.</p>
