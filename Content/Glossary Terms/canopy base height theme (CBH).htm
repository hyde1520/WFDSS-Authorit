    <h1 class="heading1">canopy base height theme (CBH)</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">A raster theme in the Landscape File that is important for determining transition from surface fire to crown fire. CBH is a stand-level descriptor and it should incorporate the effects of ladder fuels (if present) in increasing vertical continuity and assisting transition to crown fire. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">For example, typically a mature, dense, multi-storied Spruce/Subalpine Fir stand would have a CBH of less than a meter, while an open park of old growth Ponderosa Pine could have a CBH of 10 meters or more. Conditions in between these two extremes are more difficult to estimate. Values (in WFDSS Landscapes) are in meters, with precision of the fire behavior calculations limited to the nearest 1/10th meter. </p>
