    <h1 class="heading1">database</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">One or more structured sets of persistent data, managed and stored as a unit and generally associated with software to update and query the data. A simple database might be a single file with many records, each of which references the same set of fields. A GIS database includes data about the spatial locations and shapes of geographic features recorded as points, lines, areas, pixels, grid cells, or TINs, as well as their attributes (<a href="http://resources.arcgis.com/glossary">ESRI Dictionary</a>).</p>
