    <h1 class="heading1">management requirement shapes</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Management Requirement shapes are shapes that can be used to represent temporal or condition based requirements. This allows a unit’s direction to change throughout fire season as species of concern migrate, or drought conditions worsen or improve to name a few examples. Units control their own Management Requirement shapes. They can upload them or draw them directly in WFDSS. Written direction supports Management Requirement shapes. </p>
