    <h1 class="heading1">raster data</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">A spatial data model that defines space as an array of equally sized cells arranged in rows and columns, and composed of single or multiple bands. Each cell contains an attribute value and location coordinates. Unlike a vector structure, which stores coordinates explicitly, raster coordinates are contained in the ordering of the matrix. Groups of cells that share the same value represent the same type of geographic feature. (<a href="http://resources.arcgis.com/glossary">ESRI Dictionary</a>)</p>
