    <h1 class="heading1">canopy cover theme</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Necessary in the Landscape File for computing wind reduction factors and shading in the dead fuel moisture model (Nelson). Canopy cover is the horizontal percentage of the ground surface that is covered by tree crowns. It is a stand-level descriptor.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">If the canopy cover theme has a value of zero for a cell, then the data in the canopy bulk density, canopy base height, and stand height themes are ignored for that cell in a simulation since the model assumes there is no tree cover for that cell.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Canopy Cover is NOT the same as crown closure. Canopy cover is measured as the horizontal fraction of the ground that is covered directly overhead by tree canopy. Crown closure refers to the ecological condition of relative tree crown density. Stands can be said to be "closed" to recruitment of canopy trees, but still only have 40% or 50% canopy cover.</p>
