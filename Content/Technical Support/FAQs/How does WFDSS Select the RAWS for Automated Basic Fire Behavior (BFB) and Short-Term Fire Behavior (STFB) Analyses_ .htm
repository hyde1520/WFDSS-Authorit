    <h1 class="heading1">How does WFDSS Select the RAWS for Automated Basic Fire Behavior (BFB) and Short-Term Fire Behavior (STFB) Analyses? </h1>
    <p class="bodytext">WFDSS selects the RAWS by doing the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Identifying the center of the landscape extent</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Calculating the distance from the center to the nearest RAWS using a horizontal/vertical (elevation) algorithm</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Ranking the stations</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Selecting the station that is the “closest” and has weather data requisite for conditioning (7 days of hourly weather observations)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">The RAWS that is selected for the automated WFDSS models cannot be changed. If a different RAWS station is desired an analyst assisted model must be used. </p>
