    <h1 class="heading1">How does fuel moisture conditioning work in Basic Fire Behavior (BFB) and Short-Term Fire Behavior (STFB)? </h1>
    <p class="bodytext">The user chooses a date and time for which they want the analysis to start. WFDSS looks back for the last 7 + days (up to 14 days) to obtain the necessary RAWS observations for automatically conditioning the dead fuels and determining dead fuel moisture values as of the analysis date and time. The moisture values are based on the weather, as well as the cell's aspect, elevation, and canopy cover. Those fuel moistures are then used to calculate fire behavior characteristics. To see how to view the observations used in fuel conditioning, refer to How to View WFDSS Automated Fire Behavior Inputs.</p>
