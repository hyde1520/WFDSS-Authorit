    <h1 class="heading1">What resolution is used for the landscape data in Basic Fire Behavior (BFB) and Short-Term Fire Behavior (STFB) analyses?</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">The resolution of the landscape used for BFB and STFB analyses depends on the landscape extent drawn by the user. For extents that are 10 miles by 10 miles (100 square miles) or smaller, 30-meter resolution is used. For landscapes that are larger than 100 square miles and smaller than 400 square miles, the resolution is generally 60 meters. For extents that are 20 miles by 20 miles, the resolution is 90 meters. The maximum landscape extent allowed is 900 square miles (30 miles by 30 miles), and the resolution is automatically scaled to 120 meters.</p>
