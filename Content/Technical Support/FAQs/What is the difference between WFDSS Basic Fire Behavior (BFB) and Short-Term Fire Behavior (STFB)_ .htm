    <h1 class="heading1">What is the difference between WFDSS Basic Fire Behavior (BFB) and Short-Term Fire Behavior (STFB)? </h1>
    <p class="bodytext">WFDSS provides most of the inputs (including forecasted weather) for both applications. BFB calculates and maps “snapshot in time” fire behavior outputs for an entire user-defined landscape extent. STFB calculates the "snapshot fire behavior and the fire spread (arrival time) results, as well as the fire’s major paths from a single ignition point. </p>
