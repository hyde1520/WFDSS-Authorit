    <h1 class="heading1">Can local landscape data be uploaded into WFDSS for use in Basic Fire Behavior (BFB) and Short-Term Fire Behavior (STFB)? </h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Yes. In the landscape section of an analyst-assisted fire behavior analysis, you can upload LCP files. However, you can only do an analysis for the extent of the LCP you upload. For automated BFB and STFB, the system uses the National LANDFIRE data layer.</p>
