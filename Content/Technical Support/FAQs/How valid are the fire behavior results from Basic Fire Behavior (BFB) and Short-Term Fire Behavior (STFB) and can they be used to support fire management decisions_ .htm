    <h1 class="heading1">How valid are the fire behavior results from Basic Fire Behavior (BFB) and Short-Term Fire Behavior (STFB) and can they be used to support fire management decisions? </h1>
    <p class="bodytext">As with all models, the quality of the outputs are relative to the quality of the input data. The automated versions of BFB and STFB use default settings for weather and landscape that might not be the best representation of actual conditions. Before using BFB and STFB outputs to support decision-making, critique and assess the results to decide how well they represent reality. For better model output, request an analyst-assisted BFB and STFB.</p>
