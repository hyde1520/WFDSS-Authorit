    <h1 class="heading1">What fuel moisture values are used in the Basic Fire Behavior (BFB) and Short-Term Fire Behavior (STFB) applications?</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Dead fuel moisture values are calculated by NFDRS and then conditioned based on each cell’s aspect, elevation, and canopy cover, as well as the previous 7 days of RAWS weather data. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">BFB and STFB live fuel moisture values are calculated using the Growing Season Index (GSI) and inputs from the selected RAWS. These values cannot be modified in the automated version of BFB and STFB. However, they can be viewed (see <a href="../../User Documentation/Analysis/Basic and Short-term Fire Behavior/Automated/Viewing WFDSS Automated Fire Behavior Inputs.htm">Viewing WFDSS Automated Fire Behavior Inputs</a>). In the analyst-assisted versions of BFB and STFB, the fuel moistures can be changed under the initial fuel moisture section.  The calculated live woody and herbaceous moisture, in particular, may require an analyst to make edits to better reflect real world values. Foliar moisture content is set to a default value of 100%, and this cannot be changed in the automated BFB and STFB. In the analyst-assisted versions, foliar moisture can be set from 70-140%.</p>
