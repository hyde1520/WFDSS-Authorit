    <h1 class="heading1">What is the Date and Time used for in Basic Fire Behavior (BFB) and Short-Term Fire Behavior (STFB) analyses? </h1>
    <p class="bodytext">The automated BFB uses the start date and time (and the previous 7 days of weather) to determine dead fuel moisture values and calculate fire behavior characteristics for that “snapshot in time”. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">The automated STFB uses the start date and time in the same way, but in addition, it uses that data as the beginning of the fire spread simulation. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">For the analyst assisted versions of BFB and STFB, the analysis date and hour can be set by the analyst.</p>
