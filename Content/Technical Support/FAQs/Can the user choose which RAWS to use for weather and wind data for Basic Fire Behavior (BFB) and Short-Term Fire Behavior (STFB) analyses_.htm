    <h1 class="heading1">Can the user choose which RAWS to use for weather and wind data for Basic Fire Behavior (BFB) and Short-Term Fire Behavior (STFB) analyses?</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">In the current automated version of BFB and STFB, you cannot choose which RAWS to use. You can only use the WFDSS-selected RAWS. In the Analyst-assisted versions of BFB and STFB, the fire behavior specialist can select a RAWS from a list, as long as it has the requisite observations. </p>
