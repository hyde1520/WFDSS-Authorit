    <h1 class="heading1">What is the purpose of the Automated Basic Fire Behavior (BFB) and Short-Term Fire Behavior (STFB), and how can they be used?</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">The automated BFB and STFB applications within WFDSS are designed for use by non-fire behavior specialists to quickly obtain outputs for a fire area using historic or forecast weather at a given wind speed and direction. In these models, weather and wind inputs do not change during the analysis; they represent only a snapshot in time.  These analyses can be run and viewed by the Incident Author, Owner, or anyone granted Incident privileges. The fire behavior outputs from these applications can provide insight into potential fire spread and fire behavior, however,  because they are computer generated without analyst involvement, they should be utilized only as a broad general overview. If very specific questions need to be answered to make important planning decisions an Analyst Assisted fire behavior model should be utilized.</p>
