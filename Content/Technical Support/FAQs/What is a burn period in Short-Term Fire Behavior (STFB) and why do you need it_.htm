    <h1 class="heading1">What is a burn period in Short-Term Fire Behavior (STFB) and why do you need it?</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">In STFB, the burn period is the number of hours, per operational period, that will be used for the fire spread simulation. Because the STFB model uses only one set of fuel moisture and wind (speed and direction) conditions for the entire simulation, it is important to choose the burn period carefully.</p>
