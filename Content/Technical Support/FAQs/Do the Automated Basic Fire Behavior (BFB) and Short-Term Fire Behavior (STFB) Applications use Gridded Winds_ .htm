    <h1 class="heading1">Do the Automated Basic Fire Behavior (BFB) and Short-Term Fire Behavior (STFB) Applications use Gridded Winds? </h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Yes. The wind speed and direction values are used as inputs for WindNinja to create gridded winds at 30-meter resolution. Wind speed and direction values are automatically populated with NDFD data or WIMS (RAWS) data depending on if the analysis is being made for the future or the past respectively. The user can enter their own values if desired. The wind speed value is used as an average velocity across the entirety of the landscape (as defined by the user when drawing an analysis extent). Gridded wind speed inputs will be increased over ridges and decreased in valleys and the wind direction input will change based on the influence of underlying terrain.</p>
