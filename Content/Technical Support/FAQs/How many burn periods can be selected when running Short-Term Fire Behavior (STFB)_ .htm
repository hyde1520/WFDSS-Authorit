    <h1 class="heading1">How many burn periods can be selected when running Short-Term Fire Behavior (STFB)? </h1>
    <p class="bodytext">The model allows up to 3 burn periods; however, it is crucial to keep in mind that all environmental conditions (fuel moistures, wind speed, and wind direction) are held constant for the duration of the simulation. Therefore, the user should carefully consider how many hours should be used per burn period and how many burn periods are appropriate.  You might want to choose to simulate only one or two burn periods because, in reality, fuel moistures, wind directions, and wind speeds would not be expected to remain constant for very long.</p>
