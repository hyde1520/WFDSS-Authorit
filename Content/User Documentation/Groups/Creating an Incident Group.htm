    <h1 class="heading1">Creating an Incident Group<MadCap:keyword term="groups:creating " /></h1>
    <p class="bodytext">WFDSS users assigned the role of Author can create public or private <a href="../About_Topics/About Incident Groups.htm">Incident Groups </a>using a two step process. Incident Groups are also created automatically for grouped incidents (complexes) in <a href="https://wfdss.usgs.gov/wfdss_help/WFDSSHelp_abt_IRWIN_data_exchange.html">IRWIN</a>.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">You can create an Incident Group two ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">By naming the Incident Group first, then add incidents to it that you select.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">By drawing a polygon around incidents onthe Intelligencemap.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">An Incident Group is limited to 80 incidents in both Production and Training. Each Incident Group can be private or public. Private Incident Groups are available only to you, but you can share ownership if appropriate. Public Incident Groups are available to all WFDSS users. You can change an Incident group from private to public and vice versa if you are a group owner. Only a group owner or a National Editor can delete a group.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Once created, you can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <a href="Editing a Group.htm">Add or remove</a> incidents from the Incident Group.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Transfer Incident Group ownership. </li>
      <li class="listbullet">Share ownership with multiple owners.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <a href="Creating Group Filters.htm">Filter groups</a> by group name, owner, state and/or group type (public or private.)</li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <a href="">View incidents</a> in the Incident Group.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">View details, situational information, and analyses for the Incident Group.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <a href="../01a_Common User Content/Map Features/Bookmarks/Bookmarking Maps.htm">Create map bookmarks</a> for the Incident Group.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">
      <span class="specialbold">Note</span>: You cannot run analyses, reports, or create decisions for a group of incidents. Analyses, reports, and decisions are created and processed for individual incidents using the WFDSS Incidents tab's <span class="menuoptions">Decisions</span>, <span class="menuoptions">Reports, </span>and <span class="menuoptions">Analysis </span>sub-tabs.</p>
