    <h1 class="heading1">About the Date Filter (FSPro)</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">These dates, selected by a Fire Behavior Specialist, determine the range of days and corresponding data that will be used to <a href="../Analysis/FSPro/Generating ERC Classes (FSPro).htm">generate ERC percentile classes</a>. The default date range is based on the Geographic Area and should be evaluated and adjusted as needed by the FBS. When setting a date filter, you can modify the start year, but the end year is always the current year. When modifications are made to either the Station Information or the Date Filter, always click the Generate ERC Classes button to update the ERC table. The date filter is one of the most important station considerations when <a href="../Analysis/FSPro/Selecting a Weather Station for ERC Classes (FSPro).htm">selecting a weather station for generating ERC percentile classes</a> because it will determine if the station has suitable weather data for the time period you are interested in modeling. A minimum of 20 years of data is recommended, but it's important to ensure there are no large gaps in the data, especially if the station has a very long record.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">The actual weather data available for an individual station is unique to each station. The number of years, months or days within a specific year that actual weather data exists cannot be determined in WFDSS and it may be more appropriate to determine date filter values outside the WFDSS system. You can download a .FWX file of weather data for the selected weather station for closer examination in Fire Family Plus to help you determine if sufficient data exists for a specific time period.</p>
