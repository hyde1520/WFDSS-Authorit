    <h1 class="heading1">About the Incident Content Tree</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">The Incident Content Tree is a collection of all content associated with an incident, parts of which will be used in building a decision; such as outputs from fire behavior assessments, values at risk products, and uploaded maps and photos. The Incident Content Tree can be accessed from the Reports tab when building custom reports, or by clicking the Incident Content Library menu option. It’s also available to Incident Owner or Editors editing pending decision content using the <a href="../../zzzz_Sandbox/5.3Release/About the Advanced Decision Editor.htm">Advanced Decision Editor</a>, and contains all content for an incident that has been: </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Saved or captured from a WFDSS display or map. </li>
      <li class="listbullet">Uploaded from outside of WFDSS. </li>
      <li class="listbullet">Published in past decisions. </li>
      <li class="listbullet">Included in a current pending decision. </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">When using the Advanced Decision Editor, the Incident Content Tree is located in the left pane, beneath the <a href="About the Decision Content Tree.htm">Decision Content Tree</a>. Incident Owners and Editors can access the Incident Content Tree when editing a pending decision and can add content from the incident content to the decision content using the <a href="../Decision/About the Text Editor.htm">Text Editor</a> tools. To view incident content, you must change the Text Editor view from decision content to incident content by clicking Incident Content at the bottom of the page. You can select Decision Editor (located above Text Editor tools) to return to the decision content view. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">Content captured, or saved from a WFDSS display or map, or uploaded from outside of WFDSS is saved to the Incident Content Tree as part of the incident history documentation. It is not automatically added to the decision content for a pending decision; you will have to add the content manually. For example, if you upload a photo of fire behavior for an incident, the image is stored in the images folder in the Incident Content Tree, see <a href="../01a_Common User Content/Map Features/Uploading Images.htm">Uploading Images</a> for more information. From there, you can insert the image into the decision content, wherever you see fit. If you do not manually add a saved, captured, or uploaded image to your decision content, the image remains in the incident content, unused. </p>
    <p class="note">
      <span class="specialbold">Note:</span> You need to add this information to the decision document before it can be included in a decision. If it is not added to the decision, it is stored for a limited time in the system. Decision content for published decisions is permanently stored in WFDSS.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">The Incident Content Tree will include (at a minimum): </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">

    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">The Incident Content Tree may contain fire behavior analysis input and some output information if those particular analyses for an incident are accepted as complete. Fire Behavior model settings and inputs are saved to Incident Content, as well as lists of known values that intersect model outputs such as Values Lists or Values at Risk inventories. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">Fire behavior analysis content saved to the Incident Content Tree is textual in nature and does not contain images of fire behavior outputs. These types of Images must be captured by an Incident Owner or Editor, and then manually added to the Decision Content Tree from the Images folder in the Incident Content Tree. Doing this ensures the images are included in a pending decision. </p>
