    <h1 class="heading1">About Weather Station Information (BFB &amp; STFB, NTFB, FSPro)</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Station Information provides detailed information about the weather station you selected from the drop-down list to provide data for your fire behavior analysis. Station information, derived from WIMS, will help you evaluate the suitability of the selected weather station, but it is not intended to be the sole evaluative source when <a href="../Analysis/Selecting a Weather Station for Fire Behavior Analysis.htm">selecting a weather station for fire behavior analysis</a>. The WFDSS application also gets State of Weather (SOW) data directly from WIMS. The WIMS calculation is based on solar radiation and precipitation. Using the WIMS SOW values improves performance as the WFDSS application no longer needs to calculate this value.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">You cannot modify Station Information fields when using the Basic Fire Behavior (BFB) and Short Term Fire Behavior (STFB) or Near Term Fire Behavior (NTFB) models, but you can modify Green Up Month/Day, Grass Type, Climate Class and Slope Class fields when using FSPro. Do not change any Station Information fields unless you have good reasons to do so and be sure to <a href="../Analysis/Creating an Analysis Note.htm">create an analysis note</a> to document the reasons for your changes. Changes to one or more Station Information fields apply only to that particular analysis and will not change station information in WIMS. </p>
