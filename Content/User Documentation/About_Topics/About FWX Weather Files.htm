    <p class="bodytext">FWX Weather files (Wxobs72) are fixed field text files that contain once-daily (1300 hours) NFDRS fire weather data for a chosen RAWS. This fire weather information is collected and stored in the National Interagency Fire Management Integrated Database (NIFMID). Each FWX file is stored in a standard format that contains historic weather data through the current date, and includes all data years in the record (regardless of what dates are selected in the date filter on the ERC Classes page). </p>
    <p class="bodytext">Fire Behavior Analysts can view FWX Weather data as text files, but it is better to import them into the Fire Family Plus (FFP) software program (available at <a href="http://www.fire.org">www.fire.org)</a> to take advantage of FFP's powerful weather analysis capabilities. You can download the entire data record for a selected weather station to WFDSS, as well as from other sources such as KCFAST and FAMWEB (<a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/fire/planning/nist/ffp_v4/ffp_tt_weather_data_sources.pdf">FFP Tech Tip: Weather Data Sources and Attributes</a>).</p>
    <p class="bodytext">FWX files are delineated as follows:</p>
