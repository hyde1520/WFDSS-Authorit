    <p class="bodytext">WFDSS has six map views:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <a href="../Analysis/Intelligence Map.htm">
          <span class="specialbold">Intelligence Map</span>
        </a>
        <span class="specialbold">:</span> Provides a large-scale, national overview of incidents (based on your filter settings and user preferences). The default view is your assigned geographic area, but you can change the view in your <a href="../Home_User Profile/Changing Your System Preferences.htm">user settings</a>. You can use the <img src="" alt="" width="0" height="0" vspace="0px" hspace="0px" align="Bottom" border="0px" /> to create an incident or enter the latitude/longitude on the <span class="menuoptions">Info</span> tab. Dispatchers and fire managers commonly use this view to assess wildfires from a regional or national perspective.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <a href="About the Situation Map.htm">
          <span class="specialbold">Situation Map</span>
        </a>
        <span class="specialbold">:</span> Allows users to assess the situation for a selected incident, throughout the duration of the incident. The Situation map is available from the Incidents tab and is the most commonly used map view in WFDSS. It is the primary map used when creating, editing, and updating a decision document.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <a href="../Analysis/Analysis Map.htm">
          <span class="specialbold">Analysis Map</span>
        </a>
        <span class="specialbold">: </span>Similar to the Situation map, the Analysis map allows fire analysts to assess the landscape when creating a fire behavior analysis. It is available from the Analyses tab and is the primary map used by analysts when creating, editing, and updating an analysis.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <span class="specialbold">Landscape Map</span>: Allows fire analysts to view the landscape file that's been generated for an analysis and verify that the LCP Editor Rules applied to the landscape are working correctly. Landscape files used for analysis can also be viewed on the Analysis Map. Using the 'i' tool in all other map displays queries the default landscape data source without edits.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <span class="specialbold">Results Map</span>: Allows fire analysts to view the results of their fire behavior analyses in Review status. It also allows all users the opportunity to view accepted and completed fire behavior analyses results for any incident. The Results map for an analysis is accessible from the Analysis List.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <span class="specialbold">Unit Map</span>: Accessible from the <span class="menuoptions">Data Management</span> tab, the Unit Map allows users to quickly view a selected Unit’s outline, associated FMUs and unit shapes. The Unit Map will be especially helpful for Data Managers, as it allows immediate viewing of unit shapes recently uploaded, and will eliminate the need for users to navigate away from the Data Management tab to a different map display. It also assists with spatial fire management planning.</li>
    </ul>
