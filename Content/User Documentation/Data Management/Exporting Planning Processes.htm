    <p class="bodytext">WFDSS users assigned the role of Data Manager can export a current planning process and its associated shapes and text. A planning process is exported for two reasons; to save a 'snapshot' of the current planning process that can be used to restore the planning process at a later time and/or to enable import into the corresponding system (Training to Production or vice versa). Planning processes cannot be exported out of the system but instead can only be shared between Training and Production. The export feature can be helpful for the following situations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">A unit develops a planning process (FMU or SFP) and all associated shapes and text in Production and wants to export/copy it to Training to provide realistic training opportunities for the unit's WFDSS users.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">A data manager or unit would like to test the Spatial Fire Planning option in Training, but doesn't want to switch planning processes in Training at the cost of losing the existing FMU planning process and its associated shapes and text.</li>
    </ul>
