    <p class="bodytext">Each administrative unit and agency has a set of Strategic Objectives and Management Requirements related to the landscape and its resources. These objectives and requirements guide decision-making for the unit, including fire decisions. This planning direction is derived from NEPA-approved documents that include Land, Resource, and/or Fire Management Plans. Strategic Objectives and Management Requirements can be added to WFDSS as textual and/or spatial data, depending on the <a href="../../zzzz_Sandbox/Diane/SFP/Planning Processes available in WFDSS.htm">WFDSS Planning Process</a> chosen by the administrative unit.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Data Managers pre-load the Strategic Objectives and Management Requirements for their administrative unit to ensure that incident managers are using this information as part of their incident decision-making process. Strategic Objectives and Management Requirements are included in the decision once a <a href="../01a_Common User Content/Map Features/To create a planning area_.htm">planning area is created</a> or <a href="../Incident/Adding FMUs manually to Incident FMUs .htm">FMUs are added manually</a>.  <a href="../Incident/Incident Objectives and Requirements.htm">Incident-level objectives and requirements</a> developed for an incident should be based on these Strategic Objectives and Management Requirements.</p>
