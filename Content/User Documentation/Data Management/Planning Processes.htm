    <p class="bodytext">Two types of planning processes are available for administrative units to use in WFDSS; Fire Management Unit (FMU) planning and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIzbB9dl_hc">Spatial Fire Planning (SFP)</a>. Depending on an administrative unit’s agency affiliation, one may be preferred or mandated over another. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">The unit's WFDSS Data Manager works with Unit personnel to develop spatial data to support the planning process they've chosen to use, and then work with their Agency's WFDSS/GIS Lead to get FMU or Strategic Objective (SO) shapes uploaded into the system. Other supporting shapes such as Management Requirements and Other Unit Shapes can be uploaded by a Data Manager.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Once a planning process has been created, in Training or Production, it can be exported/imported into the other system. Matching planning processes in Training and Production allow for pre-season refresher training that mimics an active incident and better prepares units when active incidents occur.</p>
