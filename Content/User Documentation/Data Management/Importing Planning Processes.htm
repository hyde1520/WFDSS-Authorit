    <p class="bodytext">WFDSS users assigned the role of Data Manager can import a planning process and its associated shapes and text. Importing occurs from within WFDSS Training or Production, and not from outside of the system. Importing a planning process can introduce an new planning process and associated shapes and text to Training from Production (or visa versa), or can be used to restore a planning process if it was switched accidentally or for training purposes. This can be helpful for the following situations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">A unit develops a planning process (FMU or SFP) and all associated shapes and text in Production and wants to import it to Training to provide realistic training opportunities for the unit's WFDSS users.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">A data manager or unit would like to test the Spatial Fire Planning option in Training and switch to it temporarily, but doesn't want to switch at the cost of losing the existing FMU planning process and associated shapes and text.</li>
    </ul>
