    <h1 class="heading1">Setting up FMU or SO Codes<MadCap:keyword term="data management:FMU codes:setup" /></h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Each Unit chooses to use either FMU Codes or Strategic Objective (SO) Codes to indicate the general fire strategy for that part of the landscape. The type of Codes used depends on the Planning Process selected by the user at Data Management&gt;FMU/SO Codes&gt;Unit Selection&gt; Planning Process; SO Codes are used with the Spatial Fire Planning Process. One or more FMU/SO Codes are drawn to cover the entire Unit, each with a unique name (e.g. "FMU 1", "Riparian Zone"). FMU/SO Codes can be non-contiguous, but cannot overlap. They provide a "container" where Strategic Objectives reside.   </p>
    <p class="bodytext">FMU codes can be entered by the Data Manager as "text only" or submitted as shapefiles to the WFDSS Geospatial Team who must upload spatial FMU data. SO Codes must be submitted to the WFDSS Geospatial Team with the SO shapefiles. See the Home page under Data&gt;WFDSS Geospatial Team Contacts to find out how and when to submit data.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">You must have the Data Manager user role to manage FMU/SO Codes. Check your user roles by going to My Home&gt;User Roles, or filter on Data Manager in the My Home&gt;Address Book to find the Data Manager for your Unit.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Data Managers maintain FMU or SO Codes for their units and should consider the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">FMU or SO Codes (i.e. names) must match the name for the FMU or SO polygons.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">FMU or SO Codes must be unique for the unit and agency combination (e.g., You can only have one FMU or SO labeled "10" for NMGNF - Gila National Forest).</li>
      <li class="listbullet">FMUs or SOs can be non-contiguous but cannot overlap.</li>
    </ul>
