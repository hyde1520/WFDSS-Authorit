    <p class="bodytext">Unit Shapes refer to the broad range of shapes that are uploaded for an administrative unit and include Fire Management Unit shapes, <a href="../../zzzz_Sandbox/4.7_Release/Strategic Objective Shapes.htm">Strategic Objective shapes</a>, <a href="../../zzzz_Sandbox/4.7_Release/Management Requirement Shapes.htm">Management Requirement shapes</a>, and <a href="../../zzzz_Sandbox/Diane/SFP/Other Unit Shapes.htm">Other Unit Shapes</a> that contain information about local values data. Unit Shapes apply to the administrative unit and are different from incident shapes (perimeters, M.A.P.s, etc.) and analysis shapes (ignitions, barriers, etc.). Unit shapes are used by both the FMU and SFP <a href="../../zzzz_Sandbox/Diane/SFP/Planning Processes available in WFDSS.htm">planning processes</a> and are managed by users assigned the Data Manager role from the Data Management perspective in WFDSS.</p>
    <p class="note">
      <span class="specialbold">Note</span>: While FMU and Strategic Objective shapes are submitted to a WFDSS Data Contact for submission to WFDSS, Management Requirement and Other Unit Shapes are managed at the local administrative unit level. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">Unit shapes can be points, lines or polygons and with the exception of FMUs and Strategic Objectives, can be <a href="Uploading Unit Shapes.htm">uploaded</a> as a zipped shapefile by a WFDSS user assigned the role of Data Manager. Data Managers can view uploaded shapes in the Unit Fire Planning map layers on the Unit Map, and draw new shapes there as well. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">Before uploading Unit Shapes (to include Management Requirement and/or Other Unit Shapes) for a unit, your unit's FMUs or Strategic Objective shapes must be included in the national FMU layer. Contact the <a href="http://frames.nbii.gov/portal/server.pt?open=512&amp;objID=688&amp;&amp;PageID=3492&amp;mode=2&amp;in_hi_userid=2&amp;cached=true">WFDSS GIS Team</a> for assistance.</p>
