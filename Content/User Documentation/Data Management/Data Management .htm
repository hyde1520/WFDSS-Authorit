    <p class="bodytext">Find the Data Management perspective by clicking the Data Management tab. This tab is active for all users to view data associated with a unit, but users assigned the Data Manager role can choose a Planning Process for the unit and edit data. The top half of the screen displays the Unit Selection at all times. The bottom half of the screen is dictated by the tab selection, described below. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">All users can select different radio buttons for Geographic Area and Agency to populate the Unit list; <span class="emphasis">however</span>, the Unit list is dictated by your Contact Information under the My Home tab. For example, if your Contact Information under the My Home tab is the Eastern Geographic Area and the Agency is USDA Forest Service, no matter what radio buttons you select under the Data Management tab, the Units listed will always be Eastern Geographic Area/Forest Service units. Edit your Contact Information as needed to access unit data as required. Keep in mind that WFDSS keeps a log of users' actions as data are edited, so be nice and don't edit data if you don't have permission from the unit.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">The Data Management tab has five sub-tabs. </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">When you click a sub-tab, the content on the bottom half of the page changes. Data Managers can edit and/or view:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Fire Management Unit (FMU)/Strategic Objective (SO) Codes (FMU/SO codes sub-tab),</li>

    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">Data Managers can pre-load information for the first three items above, so the unit has information readily available during an incident. The Unit Map allows a quick check of recently uploaded unit shapes to ensure that each displays correctly . Before starting the upload process, you need the following information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">FMU or SO codes for your units and agency (FMU or SO codes must match the FMU or SO codes in the spatial data layer; FMU codes can be used still be used if there is not a spatial FMU layer)</li>

      <li class="listbullet">Land Management Plans</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Resource Management Plans</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Fire Management Plans </li>
      <li class="listbullet">Local shapefiles frequently used in wildfire decisions</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">It is important to include this information so there is access during any decision-making process, and information is included correctly in the system of record for the incident. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">Data Managers can click the Show History link (just below the Strategic Objectives/Management Requirements section) to review <a href="Viewing Data Management Change History.htm">change history</a> for a unit and if needed, filter information by entry date range, types, and/or actions.
