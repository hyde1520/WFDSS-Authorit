    <p class="bodytext">Data Managers can export, import, or delete unit planning processes that include active FMU/Strategic Objective codes, active Strategic Objectives, active Management Requirements and associated shapes and/or text for each, between Training and Production. Other Unit shapes are not affected, and remain in the Unit Fire Planning map layers. This feature enables Data Managers to export planning process data and later replace this data using the import planning processes. </p>
