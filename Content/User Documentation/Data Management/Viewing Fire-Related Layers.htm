    <p class="bodytext">The Fire-Related layers can provide very useful information regarding the fire area. The active MODIS and historical fires, if they exist, can provide valuable situational awareness. If you know the primary direction of fire growth and potential effects of current and forecasted winds, you can determine if recent fire scars are available to act as barriers or slow fire spread.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Analysis-Assisted BFB and STFB, NTFB and FSPro fire behavior models can use landscape data modified to account for fire scars and associated changes in fuel types to determine the likely impacts of historical fires on fire spread. The automated versions of BFB and STFB cannot and do not use modified landscape data.</p>
