    <p class="bodytext">All Barrier shapefiles <a href="Creating a Barrier.htm">drawn</a>, <a href="Copying a Shape.htm">copied</a> or <a href="http://wfdss.usgs.gov/wfdss_help/WFDSSHelp_upload_shapes.html">uploaded</a> for an incident are available for analysts to choose from when selecting a Barrier File for a fire behavior analysis. When selecting a Barrier File, ensure that it does not overlap the Ignition File. Otherwise, you could get unexpected results from your analysis.</p>

    <p class="note">
      <span class="specialbold">Note: </span>For each fire behavior analysis, you can select only one Ignition File and/or one Barrier File. For example, when you select the Ignition File and/or Barrier File from the Model Information Menu Option and then select another Ignition File and/or Barrier File from the Analysis Map for the same fire behavior analysis, the file(s) selected in the Analysis Map will override selections made in the Model Information Menu Option. These options provide flexibility for analysts to develop a workflow that works best for them when developing an analysis. </p>
