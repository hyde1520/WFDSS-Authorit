    <h1 class="heading1">Selecting Analysis Shapefiles from the Analysis Map</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Fire Behavior Specialists can select an Ignition File and/or a Barrier File from within the <a href="../../../Glossary Terms/LayerSwitcher.htm">LayerSwitcher</a> in the Analysis Map. Selecting Shape Files from the LayerSwitcher is helpful because you can visually see which shape you are selecting and your selection is saved automatically. Clicking <span class="buttons">Save </span>is not required as it is when you select Analysis Shape Files from the Model Information Menu Option.</p>
    <p class="note">
      <span class="specialbold">Note:</span> For each fire behavior analysis, you can select only one Ignition File and/or one Barrier File. For example, when you select the Ignition File and/or Barrier File from the Model Information Menu Option and then select another Ignition File and/or Barrier File from the Analysis Map for the same fire behavior analysis, the file(s) selected in the Analysis Map will override selections made in the Model Information Menu Option. These options provide flexibility for analysts to develop a workflow that works best for them when developing an analysis.</p>
