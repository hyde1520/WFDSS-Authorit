    <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../../01_Common Content/Notes, Cautions, Warnings/unit shape size warning.flsnp" />
    <p class="bodytext">Before selecting unit shapes to upload consider the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Review national data sets within WFDSS before determining what to upload as a unit shape.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Start by uploading four tofive shapes you will use this fire season. These shapes couldrepresent areas outlined in your Fire Management Plan (FMP), Land and Resource Management Plan (LRMP),special management areas, or other areas that may not be included in your FMU shapes.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Include thevalues reports for all layers for those shapes with values that you would like displayed in STFB, NTFB, or Planning Area Values Inventory (VI) tables or FSPro Values at Risk (VAR) tables. The values information may be helpful in developing and documenting a decision.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Unit shapes are visible onall maps within WFDSS andfor anyone with a WFDSS account.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">After you upload a unit shape, you cannot view the shapefile attributes, however, you can enter descriptive information about the shape in the Label section (20 characters), Category section (20 characters), and Description section(128 characters.) It is helpful to include the name of the person uploading the shapefile in the description. The Label is associated with the shape on the map and the Category builds the folder structure for the unit shapes in the Layerswitcher.</li>
    </ul>
