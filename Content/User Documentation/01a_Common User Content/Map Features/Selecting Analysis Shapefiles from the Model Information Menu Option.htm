    <h1 class="heading1">Selecting Analysis Shapefiles from the Model Information Menu Option</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Fire Behavior Specialists can select an Ignition File and/or a Barrier File from the drop-down lists available on the Model Information page.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">If you're working from a copied analysis, the shapes used in the previous analysis are still selected. It's also easy to select the wrong shape when many shapes exist for an incident. Take care to select the correct shape for the current analysis and be sure to click save after your selection.</p>
    <p class="note">
      <span class="specialbold">Caution</span>: Be sure to click <span class="buttons">SAVE</span> after making your selections. If you navigate away from the page before you save your selections, your selections will be lost.</p>
    <p class="note">
      <span class="specialbold">Note</span>: For each fire behavior analysis, you can select only one Ignition File and/or one Barrier File. For example, when you select the Ignition File and/or Barrier File from the Model Information Menu Option and then select another Ignition File and/or Barrier File from the Analysis Map for the same fire behavior analysis, the file(s) selected in the Analysis Map will override selections made in the Model Information Menu Option. These options provide flexibility for analysts to develop a workflow that works best for them when developing an analysis. </p>
