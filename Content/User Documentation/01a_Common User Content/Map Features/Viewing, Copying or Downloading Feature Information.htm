    <p class="bodytext">The Feature Information tool allows you to access and reuse feature information for features contained by National data layers and works in conjunction with the Identify tool (<a href="Copying a Shape.htm">user-generated shapes are copied and reused using the Select tool</a>). You can also query values layers that may intersect your point of interest.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">After you've selected a feature with the Identify tool, you can click the Feature Information tool (located on the <span class="menuoptions">Info tab</span> in a WFDSS map display), and:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">view specific information about a feature,</li>
      <li class="listbullet">copy a feature shape and save it as a different type of shape, or</li>
      <li class="listbullet">download the shape or a subset of that shape layer (depending on what type of layer it is). </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">For example, if you are viewing NPS buildings in the vicinity of a fire, you can determine what types of buildings they are, their construction type, cost to replace, etc. These facts help you better understand what types of values are at risk.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">If you want to save a historic fire perimeter as a landscape mask or other type of shape, you can select the fire perimeter, select feature information, and then copy the shape as a landscape mask.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">If you want to download a historic fire perimeter, you can select the fire perimeter and download that particular shape. If you want to download a particular trail or road, you can select the trail or road, and then download the subset of the National data layer that contains the trail you are interested in. Not all National data layers (and subsets of) are available for download from WFDSS at this time. Check the <a href="https://wfmrda.nwcg.gov/SpatialData/Docs/WFDSSShapeAttributeTable.pdf">shape attribute table</a> for feature information availability.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">With this tool, you can also query additional values layers that may intersect your point of interest.</p>
