    <p class="bodytext">On map displays other than the Intelligence and Incident Group maps, you can capture map displays in a snapshot photo you can add to your decision document. These captured map displays are called map <a href="../../../About_Topics/About Images.htm">images</a>. Map displays that show fire perimeters, M.A.P.s, critical values, or fire behavior outputs are a few examples of images that are helpful to capture and help describe the complexities of an incident. You can capture map images that use WFDSS topos, US States or USGS-sourced base layers. These are the only base layers that can be copied or reproduced in WFDSS due to copyright issues.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Capturing images requires two inputs: Image Label and Description. When developing Image Labels and Descriptions, special characters are not allowed; WFDSS warns you that special characters need to be removed before the application can successfully capture an image. Captured images are saved to the Images folder for an incident. When working with the advanced decision editor, the image folder can be accessed in the <a href="../../../About_Topics/About the Incident Content Tree.htm">Incident Content Tree</a>. When working with the default decision editor, images are available when you insert sections into a decision.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">When capturing images, you can also choose to assign the image a Report name to <a href="../../../Reports/Capturing Map Images as Landscape-Oriented Reports.htm">generate a report that includes a landscape-oriented image of the map capture</a>. Once created, these types of reports are available on the Reports tab and can be <a href="../../../Data Management/Editing Landscape-Oriented Reports.htm">edited</a> or downloaded and shared as .pdfs. You can capture images without creating reports, but you can't create a report without also entering an image label and capturing an image.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">If you'd like to use images created outside of WFDSS to support your documentation, you can <a href="../Uploading Images.htm">upload</a> images for use in an incident's decision document. Captured map images are not available for download. </p>
