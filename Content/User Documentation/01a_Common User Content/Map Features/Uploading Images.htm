    <p class="bodytext">Often, decision documents require <a href="../../About_Topics/About Images.htm">images</a> and other data that are not created in WFDSS. You can upload the following types of images to WFDSS to support a decision:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">maps (such as maps of nearby fuels treatments)</li>
      <li class="listbullet">photos (fire behavior or fuels for example)</li>
      <li class="listbullet">weather (spot weather forecasts if used)</li>
      <li class="listbullet">miscellaneous</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">You can upload images from almost any WFDSS screen using the Upload Images menu option located on the left, or from within the default decision editor when inserting content. This makes images easy to upload when planning your decision or adding them as last minute content when finalizing your decision using the editing feature.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Uploading images requires more inputs  than <a href="Info tab/Capturing Map Images.htm">capturing images</a>. In addition to Image Label and Description, you will need to select an Image Type and browse to where the image is located. Special characters are not allowed when creating Image Labels and Descriptions; WFDSS will warn you that special characters need to be removed before the application can successfully upload an image.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">When uploading images, the default selection is <span class="specialbold">Compress image to fit</span>. Unless deselected, uploaded images are compressed, as needed, to ensure size compatibility with decisions. If WFDSS determines that an image is too large to fit in a decision, the image is compressed for easier viewing and better, faster performance when downloading draft or published decisions. If WFDSS determines an image does fit in a decision, the image is not compressed. The default (and recommended) setting ensures that WFDSS can compress images, if needed, for easier use in the application.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Uploaded images are saved to the Images folder for an incident and are available when using both the default and advanced decision editors. When using the default decision editor, images are available when you choose to insert a section. When using the advanced decision editor, the Images folder is located in the incident content tree located in the lower left pane.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">You can upload the following file types:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">.JPG</li>
      <li class="listbullet">.GIF</li>
      <li class="listbullet">.PNG</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">
      <span class="specialbold">NOTE</span>
      <span class="emphasis">:</span> You cannot upload a  *.BMP, *.TIFF image or a *.PDF</p>
