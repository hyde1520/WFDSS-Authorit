    <p class="bodytext">Barrier files can be created as lines or polygons on the Map pages. For instance, if you know that the creek is a barrier to surface fire spread, but landscape data show that the fuel models are all burnable in the area represented by the creek, you could create a barrier file. Keep in mind that fire barriers will block surface fire spread. However, torching trees could cause the fire to spot over the barrier (in reality as well as within the fire behavior model). </p>
