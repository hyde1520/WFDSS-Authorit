    <p class="bodytext">WFDSS provides a robust set of tools that allow Incident Owners (must be an Author to be an owner), Incident Editors (any WFDSS user can be assigned editing privileges), and analysts to draw shapes on the Situation and Analysis maps. Points, lines, rectangles and polygons can be drawn to represent fire perimeters, planning areas, M.A.P.s, incident obj. shapes, points of interest, analysis ignitions, barriers or landscape masks. The following rules apply:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Incident owners and editors can draw all shape types.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Users assigned the Dispatcher role can drawall shape types except for planning areas, M.A.P.s and objective shapes for incidents in their geographic area. If a Dispatcher is given incident editing privileges, that person can draw those shapes, too. </li>
      <li class="listbullet">Fire Behavior Specialists can draw all shape types except for M.A.P.s and incident obj. shapes in any geographic area. If an analyst is given incident editing privileges, that person can draw those shapes, too.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">Users can draw multi-part shapes (such as a main fire and a spot fire), or you can <a href="Merging Two Shapes.htm">merge</a> existing shapes to create a new shape. Users cannot draw a polygon to represent a fire perimeter with pockets of unburned fuel, however, you can upload this type of shape, if needed. See <a href="../../About_Topics/About Maps.htm">About Maps</a> for a detailed explanation about each drawing tool and <a href="About Shapes.htm">About Shapes </a>for additional information about managing shapes.</p>
