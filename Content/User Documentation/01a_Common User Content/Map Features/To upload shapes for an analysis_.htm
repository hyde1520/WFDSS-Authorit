      <li class="listnumber">Select the Shape Type.</li>
      <li class="listnumber">Select the Shape Date and Time. This is the effective date for the shape, and is beneficial for tracking the history related to the types of shapes uploaded.</li>

        <p>To view the shape:</p>
        <ol>
          <li class="listalpha2">In the left pane of the <span class="menuoptions">Map </span>tab, verify that the Incident and Analysis layers are turned on.</li>
          <li class="listalpha2">If the Incident and Analysis layers are not checked, click the + sign for each to expand the layer options.</li>
          <li class="listalpha2">Select the shape you just uploaded (the description you entered when <a href="../../Incident/Uploading Shapes.htm">uploading the shape</a> appears in the list). </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="bodytext">The shape should appear on your map view. If it doesn't, that means that either the latitude/longitude are wrong in the shape or incident, or you uploaded the wrong shape. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">Try zooming out until you see the shape description, then use the hand (panning) tool to move the shape to the center of your screen before zooming in.</p>
