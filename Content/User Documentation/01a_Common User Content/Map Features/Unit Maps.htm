    <p class="bodytext">The Unit Map, available from the Data Management<span class="menuoptions" />tab, allows users to quickly view a selected administrative unit’s outline, or associated <a href="../../Data Management/Unit Shapes.htm">Unit Shapes</a> that may include FMUs, Strategic Objectives, Management Requirements and/or <a href="../../../zzzz_Sandbox/Diane/SFP/Other Unit Shapes.htm">Other Unit Shapes</a>. The Unit Map is especially helpful for Data Managers, as it allows for immediate viewing of Unit Shapes recently <a href="../../Data Management/Uploading Unit Shapes.htm">uploaded</a> (eliminating the need for users to navigate away from the Data Management tab to a different map display) and drawing of unit shapes. It also assists with spatial fire management planning.</p>

For this reason, you cannot create, copy, or manage incident and analysis shapes from the unit map. All other map layers are available for viewing.</p>
