    <p class="bodytext">Tools for drawing, manipulating, and downloading shapes are available from the Situation and Analysis Map views. <a href="../../About_Topics/About Maps.htm">About Maps</a> refers to these tools and their use. Shapes cannot be shared between incidents, but a shape can be downloaded from one incident and uploaded into another. Shapes can be deleted provided that the shape has not been used in an analysis or included in a decision.</p>
