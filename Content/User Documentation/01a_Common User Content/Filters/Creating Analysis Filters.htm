    <h1 class="heading1">Creating Analysis Filters<MadCap:keyword term="filters:permanent" /><MadCap:keyword term="filters:analysis" /></h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Analysis filters allow you to save your preferences for sorting the analysis list so that you can easily locate the analyses that you need. For example, if you are a Fire Behavior Specialist, you might only want to see analyses that are assigned to you in your Analysis List. To do this, you would create a filter that filters for only your analyses and you would select that filter as your default. Each time you log into WFDSS, those analyses will appear in your Analysis List.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">You can create filters for analysis selecting the <span class="buttons">Edit Filter</span> or <span class="buttons">Manage Filters</span> options, which are located above the analysis list.</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Edit Filter is primarily for <a href="Editing an Analysis Filter.htm">editing existing filters </a>or for <a href="Applying an Analysis Filter Temporarily.htm">applying analysis filters temporarily</a>, but allows you to clear current selections to create a new filter.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Manage Filters allows you create new filters, <a href="Deleting an Analysis Filter.htm">delete analysis filters </a>or select a default filter.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">An analysis filter, once created, appears in the filters drop-down list and is available for you to use each time you log into WFDSS. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">WFDSS Production and Training do not share filters; you will have to re-create filters as needed on each system if you choose.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Analysis filters can be created two ways:</p>
    <p class="heading2">To create an analysis filter using the Manage Filters button:</p>
