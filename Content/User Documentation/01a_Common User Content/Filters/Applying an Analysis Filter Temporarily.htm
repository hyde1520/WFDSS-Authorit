    <h1 class="heading1">Applying an Analysis Filter Temporarily<MadCap:keyword term="filters:temporary" /><MadCap:keyword term="filters:analysis" /></h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Applying a filter temporarily allows you to quickly locate an analysis without having to create a permanent filter, as you may not be interested in referencing the analysis again. For example, if you have been asked to review a fire behavior analysis for a fire on a neighboring district, you can use the temporary filter to find the incident and the analysis in WFDSS, without adding a new filter to your analysis filter drop-down list.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">When defining a temporary filter, you can use whichever criteria that best suits your search. In this case, you could search for the incident and locate all analyses for the incident; you could search for all analyses performed by a specific Fire Behavior Specialist or you could search for recent analyses for that particular unit to name a few.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">You can apply a filter temporarily by selecting <span class="buttons">Edit Filter</span>, which is available above the analysis list. Temporary filters are not saved to the filters drop-down list, and are lost if you create a new filter, view an existing filter, or if you log out of WFDSS. (To create a filter, see <a href="Creating Analysis Filters.htm">Creating Analysis Filters</a>.)</p>
