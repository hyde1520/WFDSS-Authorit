    <h1 class="heading1">Applying an Intelligence Filter Temporarily<MadCap:keyword term="filters:temporary" /></h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Applying a filter temporarily allows you to quickly locate an incident without having to create a permanent filter, as you may not be interested in referencing the incident again. For example, if you are asked to review a decision for a fire on a neighboring district, you can apply a filter temporarily to help you locate the incident, without adding a new filter to your filter drop-down list.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">You can apply a filter temporarily by selecting <span class="buttons">Edit Filters</span>, which is located above the incident list on the Incident tab, or in the left pane beside the Intelligence map. Temporary filters are not saved to the filter drop-down list, and will be lost if you create a new filter, view an existing filter, or log out of WFDSS. To create an intelligence filter, see <a href="Creating Intelligence Filters.htm">Creating Intelligence Filters.</a></p>
