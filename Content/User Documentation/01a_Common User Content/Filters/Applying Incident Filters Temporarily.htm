    <h1 class="heading1">Applying Incident Filters Temporarily<MadCap:keyword term="filters:intelligence" /><MadCap:keyword term="filters:temporary" /><MadCap:keyword term="filters:incident" /></h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Applying a filter temporarily allows you to quickly locate an incident without having to create a permanent filter, as you may not be interested in referencing the incident again. For example, if you are asked to review a decision for a fire on a neighboring district, you can apply a filter temporarily to help you locate the incident, without adding a new filter to your filter drop-down list.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">You can apply a filter temporarily by selecting <span class="buttons">Edit Filter</span>, which is located above the incident list on the Incident tab, or in the left pane beside the Intelligence map. Temporary filters are not saved to the incident filters drop-down list, and will be lost if you create a new filter, view an existing filter, or log out of WFDSS.  If you are working from the Incident tab, a filter applied temporarily will also be lost if you use the Incident Name quick search tool. (To create an incident filter, see <a href="Creating Incident Filters.htm">Creating Incident Filters</a>).</p>
