    <p class="bodytext">Filters allow you to save your preferences for displaying incidents on the Intelligence map so that you can easily view the incidents you need whenever you log into WFDSS. For example, if you are an Author, you might only want to see fires on your home unit displayed on the Intelligence map. To do this, you would create a filter that filters for only fires on your home unit, and you would select that filter as your default. Each time you log into WFDSS, those incidents will display on the Intelligence map. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">You can create filters for incidents selecting the <span class="buttons">Edit Filter</span> or <span class="buttons">Manage Filters</span> options, which are located on the Info tab (to the left of the Intelligence map display).</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Edit Filter is primarily for <a href="Editing an Intelligence Filter.htm">editing existing filters</a> or for <a href="Applying Incident Filters Temporarily.htm">applyingintelligence filters temporarily</a>, but allows you to clear current selections to create a new filter.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Manage Filters allows you create new filters, <a href="Deleting an Intelligence Filter.htm">delete intelligence filters</a>or select a default filter.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">The intelligence filter works the same as the incident filter. An intelligence filter, once created, appears in the filters drop-down list and is available for you to use each time you log into WFDSS. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">WFDSS Production and Training do not share filters; you will have to re-create filters as needed on each system if you choose.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">You can create a filter two ways:</p>
    <p class="heading2">To create an intelligence filter using the Manage Filters button:</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="listnumber">
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="To create a new intelligence filter using the Manage Filters button_.flsnp" />
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="heading2">To create an intelligence filter using the Edit Filter button:</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="listnumber">
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="To create a new intelligence filter using the Edit Filter button_.flsnp" />
