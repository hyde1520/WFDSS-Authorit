    <p class="bodytext">The link to the Feedback form appears in the upper right-hand corner of every page in WFDSS. The word Feedback is misleading because this link is intended to be used to report any issues you find with the application, not just feedback itself. Use this form to do the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Report technical issues with the application, such as when a feature behaves in a way inconsistent with how it was intended to work.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Provide feedback on how features are working in the application.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Provide feedback for potential improvements.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Provide feedback on the online help and other documentation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">Submitted feedbacks (and attachments) are received by WFDSS team members and developers via email  and are responded to promptly. Never hesitate to send feedback, especially about issues you find within the application. The sooner the developers know about an issue, the sooner they can get it resolved. The majority of enhancement suggestions are received via feedback as well, which help guide future releases and application development. The WFDSS team is dedicated to supporting WFDSS users and appreciates feedback in any form.</p>
