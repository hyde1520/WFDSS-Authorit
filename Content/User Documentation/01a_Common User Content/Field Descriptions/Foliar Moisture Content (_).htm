    <h1 class="heading1">Foliar Moisture Content (%)</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">The moisture content of overstory conifer needles, a factor affecting crown fire initiation in fire modeling systems. Default value is 100%. It can be modified in BFB, STFB, and NTFB, but not in FSPro.  Foliar moisture content is used in conjunction with canopy base height from the landscape extent to determine the threshold for surface to crown fire transition in each cell.  It is not used to calculate crown fire rate of spread or to determine the difference between predicted passive versus active crown fire. Foliar moisture can be set from 70-130% and is constant across the landscape for the duration of a simulation; it is not conditioned over time or space. The foliar moisture value generally needs to be changed only if local sampling suggests that the actual value is extremely high or low, or when crown fire behavior appears misrepresented in the outputs.</p>
