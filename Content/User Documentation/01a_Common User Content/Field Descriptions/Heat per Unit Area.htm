    <h1 class="heading1">Heat per Unit Area</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">One of the outputs calculated by WFDSS Basic Fire Behavior (BFB). Its units are displayed in the BFB legend as kilojoules per meter squared (kJ/m<span class="superscript">2</span>) or British Thermal Units per square foot (BTU/ft<span class="superscript">2</span>). It is the fireline intensity divided by the rate of spread to give heat release for an area. If flame length is equal, a faster rate of spread will direct less heat to an area than a slower moving fire (see Rothermel and Deeming, 1980).</p>
