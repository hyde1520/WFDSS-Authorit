    <h1 class="heading1">Number of Fires</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Refers to how many fire simulations you would like FSPro to run in a single analysis. The number should be large enough to account for rare events that could impact fire growth and burn probabilities as influenced by the landscape extent and landscape raster resolution.</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Selecting a lower value, such as a few hundred, ishelpful during calibration and will process quickly. </li>
      <li class="listbullet">Using a higher number of fires will result in more variation and is better suited for long-term modeling andcapturing the possibility of rare events.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">Experience over the last several years has indicated that, to account for the rare events in a simulation, a minimum of 1000 simulated fires is required. The only time fewer than 1000 fires should be considered is during the initial testing and calibration for an incident.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Larger numbers of fire simulations (&gt;1000) process much more slowly, so take care in selecting the number. Base your decision on time of year, analyses currently queued and in process, and priority of the fire.</p>
