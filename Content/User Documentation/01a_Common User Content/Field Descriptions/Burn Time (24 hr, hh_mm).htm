    <h1 class="heading1">Burn Time (24 hr, hh:mm)</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">The time fuel conditioning ends and wind speed and direction are retrieved for Basic and STFB models. This field is unique to Basic and STFB because these models do not truly have an 'Analysis Start Time'. Mid-afternoon times are often chosen to represent a worst case for burns that 'start' in the early afternoon. Both models assume static weather conditions and, therefore, the total hours burned can be broken up any number of ways to match conditions.</p>
