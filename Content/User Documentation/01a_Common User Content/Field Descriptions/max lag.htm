    <h1 class="heading1">max lag</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">This value determines the maximum number of previous days that influence the ERC on the current day. Daily ERC values are "autocorrelated" (meaning they depend statistically on values from earlier observations) with values from previous days because the moisture content of dead fuels changes more slowly than changes in weather conditions. In other words, today's value is statistically correlated with yesterday's value as well as the day before, etc, but it is less correlated with values further away from the current day.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">The rates that fuel moistures change in response to changes in weather conditions is called a "timelag" and is longer in larger diameter dead woody fuels and deeper duff layers. The default value of 30 is a reasonable value in many fuel types, especially where larger woody fuels and duff layers contribute to fire behavior. If you do not want the the correlation to go back 30 days from the start date of the analysis, you can change the number of Max Lag days. <a href="">About ERC Correlation Parameters</a> ,and <a href="max degree of fit.htm">Max Degree of Fit</a> provide additional information about Max Lag days.</p>
