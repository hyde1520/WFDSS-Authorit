    <h1 class="heading1">Crown Fire Method</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Select one of two the methods available that model crown fire: Finney (the default) or Scott and Reinhardt.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">For recent versions of LANDFIRE (2010, 2014) canopy fuel values for CBD were computed to produce more active crown fire when using the Scott and Reinhardt model compared to the Finney crown fire model. You would expect to see slower rates of spread and less fire intensity for predicted passive crown fire when using Finney versus Scott and Reinhardt crown fire models. Whatever crown fire model is chosen, it is important to calibrate your simulated fire behavior to observed fire behavior.</p>
