    <h1 class="heading1">Landscape File (LCP)</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">A GIS Raster file that provides landscape themes such as elevation, slope, aspect, and fuel model that are used in fire modeling and mapping. The file structure began in the FARSITE/FlamMap fire analysis model, but is currently available nationally from LANDFIRE, a nationwide fire, fuel and vegetation mapping project. (Paraphrased from <a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs/rmrs_gtr183"><span class="emphasis">Guidance on Spatial Wildland Fire Analysis: Models, Tools, and Techniques</span></a><span class="emphasis" />by Richard D. Stratton.)</p>
    <p class="bodytext">The LCP used in <a href="">WFDSS</a> contains all of the rasterized data themes (elevation, slope, aspect, surface fuel model, canopy cover, forest stand height, canopy base height, and canopy bulk density) needed to run geospatial fire behavior applications. </p>
