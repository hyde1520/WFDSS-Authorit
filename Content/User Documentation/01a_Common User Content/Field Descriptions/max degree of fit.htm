    <h1 class="heading1">max degree of fit</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">This value determines the detail required to achieve an adequate statistical curve-fit of the seasonal trends in ERC. ERC trends throughout a calendar year typically show one or more major peaks and troughs corresponding to dry and wet periods. A larger value in this field allows a curve-fitting procedure to better represent peaks and troughs that occur on shorter and shorter time periods. An adequate range of Max Degree of Fit is 8 to 11 the WFDSS default is 9. <a href="">About ERC Correlation Parameters</a>, and <a href="max lag.htm">Max Lag</a> provide additional information about Max Degree of Fit.</p>
