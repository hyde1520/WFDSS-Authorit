    <h1 class="heading1">Crown Fire Activity</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">One of the outputs calculated by WFDSS BFB. The output indicates the type of fire calculated at any given cell and is displayed as 1 (surface fire), 2 (passive crown fire/torching), 3 (active crown fire) and 0 (no fire).</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Since WFDSS BFB calculates fire behavior characteristics cell by cell, the crown fire activity of any cell is independent of any adjacent cells. This means active crown fire cannot "spread" cell to cell.</p>
