    <p class="bodytext">The <a href="../About_Topics/About Relative Risk.htm">WFDSS Relative Risk assessment </a>is required before publishing a decision for an incident. Its purpose is to assist you in planning for, assessing, and managing your incidents. The Relative Risk Assessment represents Part B of the overall <a href="http://www.nwcg.gov/pms/pubs/pms210/">Wildland Fire Risk and Complexity Assessment (RCA), </a>which was implemented by NWCG in January, 2014.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">The content in this section is derived from NWCG <a href="../Decision/Relative Risk Assessment Instructions/Wildland Fire Relative Risk Assessment.htm">Wildland Fire Relative Risk Assessment </a>guidance, upon which the WFDSS Relative Risk Assessment is based. When you calculate Relative Risk for an incident in WFDSS, you fulfill policy requirements and take the three risk components; <a href="../Decision/Relative Risk Assessment Instructions/Value Assessment.htm">Value</a>, <a href="../Decision/Relative Risk Assessment Instructions/Hazard Assessment.htm">Hazard</a>, and <a href="../Decision/Relative Risk Assessment Instructions/Probability Assessment.htm">Probability</a> into consideration.</p>
