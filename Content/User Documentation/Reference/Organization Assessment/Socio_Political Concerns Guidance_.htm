    <p class="bodytext">The Socio/Political Concerns are an indicator of how difficult and involved the decision is for the specific situation that may be associated with a particular fire. Key areas that influence and affect an Agency Administrator’s decision space and range of options include: the type of objectives to be implemented on the fire; the particular ownership situation; and any external influences that may exert strong influences on the Agency Administrator and his/her decision. This assessment area also allows the Agency Administrator to identify local information with attention to fire activity, local public and political opinions, and local knowledge.</p>
