    <p class="bodytext">Decision editors allow Incident Owners and Editors to add supportive text, images, and information to a decision document to help tell the story of an incident. In essence, this supportive content connects the primary parts of a decision together; it makes a decision easier to read and helps get your message across. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">WFDSS offers two decision editors for incident owners and editors to use when editing a decision, the <a href="../../../zzzz_Sandbox/5.3Release/About the Default Decision Editor.htm">Default Decision Editor </a>and the <a href="../../../zzzz_Sandbox/5.3Release/About the Advanced Decision Editor.htm">Advanced Decision Editor</a>. Each can be accessed from the Decisions tab after a decision is created, and when a user is ready to edit the pending decision. The interface for editing a decision is different for each editor, however the editable sections of a decision are the same.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Both decision editors enable decision editing, but there are benefits of using one over the other for any given incident. The Default Decision Editor provides an intuitive, quick, and easy way to put together a decision for an incident and automatically opens when a Pending Decision is edited. The Advanced Decision Editor (the editor that’s been in use since WFDSS inception) in contrast, provides advanced editing features not available in the Default Decision Editor, such as the ability add tables, add bullets or modify styles and font. It can be accessed by clicking the Convert to Advanced button on the Decision tab. The Default Decision Editor will meet the documentation needs for most incidents, but the Advanced Decision Editor will be useful for incident documentation with extensive formatting and/or additional content needs. Users can switch to the other editor midway through documenting a decision and the decision content will be saved in its current state. If you choose to switch back however, all information entered using the new decision editor will be lost.</p>
    <p class="note">
      <span class="specialbold">Note</span>: The Default Decision Editor works best with IE 11, Chrome or Firefox. We are sorry for the inconvenience and are working to find a solution other than installing a newer version of IE or using Firefox and Chrome. Users can still use the Advanced Decision Editor, which is actually the same decision editor we have been using since 2009.</p>
