    <h1 class="heading1">Decision Content: Objectives</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">The Objectives section of the decision includes information about an incident's Strategic Objectives, Management Requirements,  Incident Objectives, and Incident Requirements. When a planning area is drawn, the pre-loaded Strategic Objectives and Management Requirements are auto-populated into the decision. The incident owners/editors create the Incident Objectives/Incident Requirements from the Objectives tab (See <a href="../../Incident/Creating Incident Objectives and Requirements.htm">Creating Incident Objectives and Requirements</a>).</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Strategic Objectives and Management Requirements come from the Fire Management Plans and the Land/Resource Plans and are uploaded by a data manager well ahead of fire season. Incident owners and editors then tier these down to develop Incident-specific Objectives and Incident Requirements for the Planning Area.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">In the Objectives section of the decision, review previous inputs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Review the FMU/SO list. You can redraw your planning area to re-sample the pre-loaded spatial data. If you have questions about the pre-loaded spatial data or changes are required, contact the data manager on your local unit.<span class="specialbold" /></li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <p>Review the Strategic Objectives, Management Requirements, Incident Objectives, and Incident Requirements. Ensure that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="listbullet2">Objectives and requirements are included and orexcluded appropriately.</li>
          <li class="listbullet2">Incident Objectives and Requirements are specific to the incident.</li>
          <li class="listbullet2">Objectives and requirements include context on the intent and reasoning behind the statements. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="listbullet">Add, as appropriate, supporting text, data and analyses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </li>
