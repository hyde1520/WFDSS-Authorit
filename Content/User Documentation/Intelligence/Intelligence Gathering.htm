    <h1 class="heading1">Intelligence Gathering</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">The WFDSS Intelligence tab allows users to gather information relevant to their regions, including the Intelligence map, reports, and other data. The <a href="../About_Topics/About Maps.htm">mapping tools</a> displayed at the top of the page allow you to work with the map and <a href="../Incident/To create an incident using the map view_.htm">create an incident</a> if you are an Author or Dispatcher. If you are an Author, you can create an incident group using the polygon tool. Above the mapping tools is a <a href="../01a_Common User Content/Map Features/Bookmarks/Bookmarking Maps.htm">Bookmark button</a> that allows Dispatchers, Authors, and Editors to save their current map settings on the Intelligence map so they will be available the next time they login to WFDSS. There is also the option to share any bookmark as a link with other users whose privileges allow them to view the map context.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">By adding the spatial layer Active Planning Area in the System Preferences tab, you can display nearby active planning areas on the Intelligence map.</p>
    <p class="note">
