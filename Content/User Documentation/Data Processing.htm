    <p class="bodytext">The Wildland Fire Management Research, Development, and Applications program processes the inputs to aggregate the incoming datasets, and to assign standardized interagency attributes for each polygon. NWCG Unit IDs are assigned by crosswalking unit IDs from the NWCG Unit ID table (<a href="https://wfmi.nifc.gov/unit_id/publish/UnitIdActive.txt">https://wfmi.nifc.gov/unit_id/publish/UnitIdActive.txt</a>) using the NWCG Unit ID fields "Agency" and "Unit Name" and the PAD-US fields "Manager Name", "Owner Name", "Local Name". Spatial Joins with agency administrative boundary layers were used in some circumstances to identify unit IDs assigned at jurisdictional levels above the PAD-US "Local Name" level.</p>
