    <p class="bodytext">Decision Reviewers are responsible for examining the documentation related to a pending incident decision, and indicating whether have reviewed the decision or are returning it for edits. If they return the decision for edits, they need to include comments and/or suggestions for edits.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Marking a decision as Reviewed <span class="emphasis">does not</span> mean that the decision is approved. A decision can only be approved by the Decision Approver(s). </p>
    <p class="bodytext">Decision Reviewers must meet the following criteria:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Authority and knowledge to adequately review an incident decision within the GA where the incident occurred</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Understanding of the decision process and budgetary requirements for an incident</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Any WFDSS user role</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">While a Decision Reviewer can also be an Incident Editor, he/she cannot also be a Decision Approver for that incident. This incident privilege allows the Incident Owner to access specialists who might have specific input on a decision, but who do not have the fiscal responsibility for a decision that an Approver has. </p>
