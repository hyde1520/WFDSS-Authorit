    <p class="bodytext">Decision Approvers are responsible for examining the documentation related to an incident decision, and indicating whether they approve the decision or are returning to it for edits. If they return a decision for edits, they need to include comments as to why they rejected the decision.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Approving the decision adds it to the system of record for the incident. Once the decision is approved, it can't be altered. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">All designated Decision Approvers for an incident must approve before it becomes part of the system of record (e.g., if the incident is multi-agency, the designated Decision Approver from each agency must sign off on the decision).</p>
    <p class="bodytext">At least one Approver must complete the periodic assessment when it is due.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Decision Approvers must meet the following criteria:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Authority and knowledge to approve an incident decision within the GA where the incident occurred</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Understanding of the decision process and budgetary requirements for an incident</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Financial authority to sign-off on an incident decision</li>
      <li class="listbullet">WFDSS user role </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">While Decision Approvers are automatically granted editing privileges for the incident, they cannot also be decision reviewers for that incident.</p>
