    <p class="bodytext">In WFDSS, there are <a href="../Home_User Profile/WFDSS User Roles.htm">system-wide user roles</a> (e.g., Author, Viewer) and incident-specific privileges (e.g., Owner, Editor, Reviewer, Approver). Incident privileges are specific to each incident and determine what types of tasks a user can perform in support of the incident's documentation. For example; edit decision content, develop incident objectives and requirements, draw a planning area, or approve/publish a decision.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Incident privileges are assigned after an incident is created. When and whether you can assign incident-specific user roles depends on your system-level role:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">If an Author, GA Editor, or National Editor creates the incident, they can immediately assign team members to the incident privileges. </li>
      <li class="listbullet">If a Dispatcher creates an incident, the incident must be assigned an <a href="Incident roles/Owner.htm">Owner</a> before other incident privileges can be assigned.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">Multiple Owners can assign incident-level roles to individuals or groups; however, at least one of the Multiple Owners must be an Author, GA Editor, or National Editor. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">Each incident is assigned an owner or multiple owners. An Incident Owner can <a href="../Decision/Managing Incident Privileges.htm">grant incident-specific privileges</a> to other personnel (individuals or groups). When incident ownership is assigned to a group, an Incident Owner can add and modify roles for other individuals in the group, and delete ownership as needed. Incident Owners can also change incident ownership after <a href="Declaring an Incident Out.htm">declaring an incident out </a>for reporting and analysis purposes.</p>
