    <p class="bodytext">Because WFDSS is used for managing, tracking, and for decision reporting, duplicate incidents are not allowed. To prevent duplicate entries for incidents, WFDSS warns you if the incident you are creating meets <span class="specialbold">both</span> the following criteria:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Incident is within 1/2 mile of an existing incident.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">The discovery date and time are within 6 hours of the existing incident.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">A list of potential duplicates appears at the top of the Create New Incident page. Click the incident name to review the incident details for the potential duplicates, and verify that the incident you are attempting to create is not the same as the existing incident(s).</p>
