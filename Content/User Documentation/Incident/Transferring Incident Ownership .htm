    <p class="bodytext">Ownership of an incident may need to be transferred for a variety of reasons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">the current owner is going out of town and will not be available,</li>
      <li class="listbullet">incident complexity is increasing and additional authors are needed to assist with decision-making and documentation,</li>
      <li class="listbullet">incident is transitioning to an incident command team or a different team, or</li>
      <li class="listbullet">the size of the fire requires a higher level of authority to manage it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">Ownership is an incident-level privilege and Authors are automatically assigned ownership of incidents they create. Authors can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <a href="Transferring Incident Ownership to Another Author.htm">transfer ownership of an incident to another author</a>, or</li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <a href="Transferring Incident Ownership to a Group.htm">transfer ownership of an incident to a group of WFDSS users </a>that they’ve created in their address book.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">Only group members with Author privileges can own incidents. Members of a group that do not have author privileges can assist with document editing, review, and approval. </p>
