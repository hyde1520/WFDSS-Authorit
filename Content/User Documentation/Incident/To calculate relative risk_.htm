For example, if you are 30 days into a large fire that is now 80% contained and is anticipated to be fully controlled within 10 days, you would use the 10 days as your estimated duration, and would select Medium.</p></div></li>
      <li class="listnumber">Click the blue arrow <img src="" alt="" width="0" height="0" vspace="0px" hspace="0px" align="Bottom" border="0px" /> next to Values. The section expands to display the Values chart.</li>

      <li class="listnumber">Click <span class="buttons">Continue</span>. The Relative Risk Results page appears.</li>
      <li class="listnumber">Review the results and advice.</li>
      <li class="listnumber">Enter Relative Risk Notes to explain why you think the overall Relative Risk rating accurately depicts risk for the incident.</li>
      <li class="listnumber">Select<span class="buttons">Back </span>to revisit/edit your Values, Hazards, and/or Probability inputs -OR- Click<span class="buttons">Publish</span> to save your inputs and the overall Relative Risk results. You can also click <span class="buttons">Return</span> to leave the Relative Risk Assessment and return to the place in the application you were previous to accessing relative risk.</li>
      <li class="listnumber">The overall Relative Risk rating and associated notes for each rating chart are automatically added to theRisk section of a pending decision. The rating charts and all associated relative risk content is saved to the incident content and can be accessed by either the <a href="">Default</a> or <a href="../../zzzz_Sandbox/5.3Release/About the Advanced Decision Editor.htm">Advanced Decision Editors</a>.</li>
