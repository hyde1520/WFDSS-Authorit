    <ol>
      <li class="listnumber">From the Incident List page, select the incident you want to view shapes for.</li>
      <li class="listnumber">Click <span class="buttons">View Information</span>. The Edit Incident Information page appears.</li>
      <li class="listnumber">Select the <span class="menuoptions">Situation</span> tab. A map of the incident area appears, with a marker indicating the incident's latitude and longitude.</li>

    <ol>
      <li class="listnumber">
        <p>In the left pane of the <span class="menuoptions">Map </span>tab, verify that the incident layer is turned on.</p>
        <ol>
          <li class="listalpha2">If the incident layer is not checked, click the + sign to expand the layer options.</li>
          <li class="listalpha2">Select the shape you just uploaded (the description you entered when <a href="Uploading Shapes.htm">uploading the shape</a> appears in the list). </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="bodytext">The shape should appear on your map view. If you don't see the shape, you could be zoomed in too close. Try zooming out until you see the shape description, then use the hand (panning) tool to move the shape to the center of your screen before zooming back in.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">If the shape still doesn't appear, it could mean that either the latitude and/or longitude are wrong (for the shape or the incident), or that you uploaded the wrong shape. </p>
