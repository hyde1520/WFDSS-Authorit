    <p class="bodytext">Use the tasks in this section to manage incident ownership and other incident privileges. The following rules apply:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">An incident can be assigned to multiple owners. Multiple owners for an incident can edit the privileges of individual group members or remove an entire group without changing the Incident Owner.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Only Authors, GA Editors, and National Editors can assign or transfer Incident Owners. Only Incident Owners can assign incident privileges.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">After a fire is declared out, Incident ownership can change in order to conduct further analyses and complete fire reports.</li>
    </ul>
