    <p class="bodytext">An Incident Owner or Editor can create customized Management Action Points Reports (M.A.P.) to meet the needs of the user. You can create and publish M.A.P. reports that include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Currently active and published M.A.Ps.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">A customized selection of active, inactive, and/or yet to be published M.A.P.s.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Images of individual M.A.P.s or an image of all M.A.P.s.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Additional decision content to include objectives, action items, and so forth.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">Publishing your report locks the report's content and the content becomes permanent. Once a report is published, it can be downloaded and printed. You will not be able to publish a report that contains M.A.P.s that have yet to be published in a decision, but you can create a draft report that you can download as a .PDF for viewing and/or sharing.</p>
