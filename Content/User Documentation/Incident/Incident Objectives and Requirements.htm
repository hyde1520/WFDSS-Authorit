    <p class="bodytext">In WFDSS, there are two levels of objectives and requirements: Strategic Objectives/Management Requirements, and Incident Objectives/Incident Requirements. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">The Data Manager enters and maintains the Strategic Objectives and Management Requirements for a particular administrative unit as they become available (see <a href="../Data Management/Data Management .htm">Data Management</a>). These Strategic Objectives and Management Requirements are taken from the land, resource, and/or fire management plans that provide legal management direction for the unit and the landscape managed by it. An example of a Strategic Objective is "Protect cultural resources."  An example of a Requirement is "No retardant in riparian areas."</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Incident Objectives and Requirements, developed by Incident Owners and Editors, are specific to an incident and are based on the broader Strategic Objectives and Management Requirements that were taken from the affected unit's planning documents. You develop and enter these after you've created an incident in WFDSS and drawn a planning area on the Situation map. An example of an Incident-specific Objective is  "Minimize impacts to identified cultural resources in Cedro Canyon."  An example of a incident-specific requirement is <span class="emphasis">"</span>No retardant in Paint Rock Creek." In addition, you can <a href="Associating Shapes with Incident Objectives and Requirements.htm">associate shapes to incident objectives and requirements</a>.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Additional Incident Objectives and Requirements may be needed if an incident's planning area is modified and a different set of FMUs and/or administrative units intersect it.</p>
