    <p class="bodytext">These data are obtained through the Homeland Security Infrastructure Program (HSIP) and are protected under the agreements associated with the program itself. The  layer contains all roads plus all Road Network attributes such as direction of travel, lanes, dividers, speed category, and access restrictions. For use within WFDSS the road types have been generalized and symbolized so that each major road category is easily identified when utilizing the data for fire management applications. Attribution has been more or less removed from the source data and only the attributes required to build categorical symbology has been maintained. These data are very complete and are provided in WFDSS to serve as references to aid in the making of strategic decisions on wildfires.</p>
