    <h1 class="heading1">Overview</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">The Jurisdictional Agencies dataset is developed as a national land management geospatial layer, focused on representing wildland fire jurisdictional responsibility, for interagency wildland fire applications, including WFDSS (Wildland Fire Decision Support System), IFTDSS (Interagency Fuels Treatment Decision Support System), IRWIN (Interagency Reporting of Wildland Fire Information), and InFORM (Interagency Fire Occurrence Reporting Modules). It is intended to provide federal wildland fire jurisdictional boundaries on a national scale. The agency and unit names are an indication of the primary manager name and unit name, respectively, recognizing that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">There may be multiple owner names. </li>
      <li class="listbullet">Jurisdiction may be held jointly by agencies at different levels of government (ie State and Local), especially on private lands, </li>
      <li class="listbullet">Some owner names may be blocked for security reasons. </li>
      <li class="listbullet">Some jurisdictions may not allow the distribution of owner names. </li>
      <li class="listbullet">Private ownerships are shown in this layer with JurisdictionalUnitIdentifier=null,JurisdictionalUnitAgency=null, JurisdictionalUnitKind=null, and LandownerKind="Private", LandownerCategory="Private". All land inside the US country boundary is covered by a polygon. </li>
      <li class="listbullet">Jurisdiction for privately owned land varies widely depending on state, county, or local laws and ordinances, fire workload, and other factors, and is not available in a national dataset in most cases.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">For publicly held lands the agency name is the surface managing agency, such as Bureau of Land Management, United States Forest Service, etc. The unit name refers to the descriptive name of the polygon (i.e. Northern California District, Boise National Forest, etc.).</p>
    <p class="bodytext">These data are used to automatically populate fields on the WFDSS Incident Information page.</p>

    <p class="bodytext">It is WFM RD&amp;A's intent to register this dataset as an Authoritative NWCG Interagency dataset once a data standard for Jurisdictional Unit Polygon has been approved. </p>
