    <h1 class="heading1"> Data Input</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">The data displayed in WFDSS represent a merged layer from four original data sources (listed in the Data Information section below). Minor edits were performed on each of the source data sets to ensure a consistent format when combining them into the WFDSS version. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">The attributes of each layer were edited to attach the NWCG Unit ID, Unit Name and Agency to each polygon.  The Agency and Unit Name are then used to automatically populate the Incident Information page when and incident is created in WFDSS.  These edits did not impact the original integrity of the data, and no polygons or attribute associations were changed, removed, or added.</p>
