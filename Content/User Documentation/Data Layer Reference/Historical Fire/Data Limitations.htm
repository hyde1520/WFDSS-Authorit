    <h1 class="heading1">Data Limitations</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Fire perimeter data are often collected at the local level. Currently, there is no national fire perimeter database to collect these local data. Therefore, no consistent national dataset can be easily generated. Further complicating the issue, not all federal fire management agencies have mandatory guidelines for submitting fire perimeter shapefiles. If you do not see your fire perimeters in this layer, they are not stored in the sources used to create the layer. If this is the case, please contact your agency-specific <a href="">WFDSS GIS team contact</a>.</p>
