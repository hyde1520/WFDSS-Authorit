    <h1 class="heading1">Data Input</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">The data were obtained using the sources listed in the Data Information section below. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">The USDA Forest Service data were downloaded as Excel spreadsheets from INFRA by Forest Service Region. The resulting spreadsheets were then mapped by latitude and longitude coordinates for each region. The nine regions were then merged into one layer representing all of the Forest Service campground locations in the INFRA database. Two fields were kept in the attribute table; Site_Name, which described the name of the campground; and Agency, which was populated with “USFS” for all records in the layer. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">All data were obtained from the BLM’s Facilities and Asset Management System (FAMS) database and converted to a shapefile based on the latitude and longitude coordinates.  </p>
    <p class="bodytext">Facilities with the following type attribute were retained (all other facilities were classified as BLM <a href="http://wfdss.usgs.gov/wfdss_help/WFDSSHelp_BLM_Bdgs.html">Buildings</a>)</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Cabana Ramada </li>
      <li class="listbullet">Camping Unit Developed </li>
      <li class="listbullet">Camping Unit Semi-Improved </li>

      <li class="listbullet">Recreation Area </li>
      <li class="listbullet">Recreation Site</li>
    </ul>
