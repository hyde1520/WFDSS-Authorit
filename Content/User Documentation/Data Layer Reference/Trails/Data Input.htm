    <h1 class="heading1">Data Input</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">The data for each of these layers was compiled categorically and then each individual layer was extracted from the resulting national layer.  Minor edits were performed on the data to ensure a consistent format across layers.  The attributes of each source data set were manipulated to ensure that the trail name and type were included for each line segment.  The data were dissolved in such a way as to ensure that a consistent segment length was maintained.  This will ensure that the data perform well within the application when copying or downloading a segment of line.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">The trails data are not available for download/copy however, you can view feature information for these layers using the identify button on the maps.</p>
