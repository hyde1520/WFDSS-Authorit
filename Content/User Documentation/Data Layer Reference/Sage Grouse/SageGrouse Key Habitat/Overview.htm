    <p class="bodytext">This data set represents a generalized Sage Grouse Key Habitat map for use within the Wildland Fire Decision Support System (WFDSS), and provides an update to the species occurrence key habitat fire suppression polygon for the Sage Grouse Biological Assessment (SGBA), which identified preliminary priority sage grouse habitat areas in which to prioritize fire suppression activities in 2013. The data are broken into four categories within WFDSS (Greater Sage-Grouse Preliminary Priority Habitat (PPH), Greater Sage Grouse Preliminary General Habitat (PGH), Gunnison Sage-Grouse Proposed Occupied Habitat (POH), Gunnison Sage-Grouse Proposed Unoccupied Habitat (PUH)) which are depicted using a gradient color scheme within the application. These data are loaded as one layer in WFDSS and therefore all must be turned on in order to view the locations.</p>
