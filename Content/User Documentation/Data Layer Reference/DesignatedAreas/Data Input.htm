    <h1 class="heading1">Data Input</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">In its present state these data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large regional areas. This is a work in progress and dates on individual records represent the last known update date (see accompanying spreadsheet at http://www.wilderness.net/GIS/WildernessUpdates.xls and cross reference using WID for contact/source information where available). The intent is to replace smaller scale data with larger scale data as it becomes available. It is hoped that the end result will be a dataset at or near national map accuracy standards for 1:24000 (1:36000 for Alaska) scale data. In its present form source data varies from a scale of 1:10000 to 1:2,000,000 (see lineage for details on source scale).</p>
