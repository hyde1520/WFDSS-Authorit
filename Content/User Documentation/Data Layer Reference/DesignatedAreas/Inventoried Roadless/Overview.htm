    <p class="bodytext">This data set contains the USDA Forest Service Inventoried Roadless Areas (IRAs) for the lower 48 states, Puerto Rico, and Alaska. IRAs are based on completed forest plans, forest plans in revision where the agency has established an inventory (this information should be available in Appendix C of most forest plans), or other assessments that are completed and adopted by the agency. </p>
