    <h1 class="heading1">Data Input</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">The IRA data displayed in WFDSS were obtained from the USDA Forest Service Geospatial Service and Technology Center. These data were originally submitted to GSTC by all national forests through their regional offices for the forest service’s Roadless Area Conservation Initiative. Minor edits were performed on the data to ensure a consistent format. The attributes of the source data were edited so that the IRA and Agency names were the only two attribute fields in the final version. These edits did not impact the original integrity of the data, and no polygons or attribute associations were changed, removed, or added.</p>
