    <p class="bodytext">The NRA data displayed in WFDSS were obtained from the USDA Forest Service Geospatial Service and Technology Center. Minor edits were performed on the data to ensure a consistent format. The attributes of the source data were edited so that the NRA and Agency names were the only two attribute fields in the final version. These edits did not impact the original integrity of the data, and no polygons or attribute associations were changed, removed, or added.</p>
