    <h1 class="heading1">Data Input</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">The data displayed in WFDSS represent a merged layer from three original data sources (listed in the Data Information section below). Minor edits were performed on each of the source data sets to ensure a consistent format when combining them into the WFDSS version. The attributes of each layer were edited so that the Designation and Agency names were the only two attribute fields in the final merged version. These edits did not impact the original integrity of the data, and no polygons or attribute associations were changed, removed, or added. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">The list below outlines the designations (by agency) that are contained in this layer. </p>
