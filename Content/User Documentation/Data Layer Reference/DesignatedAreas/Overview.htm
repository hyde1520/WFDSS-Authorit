    <p class="bodytext">This data layer consists of National Wilderness Preservation System areas in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The map layer was created by combining the best available data from the federal agency responsible for administration of a given wilderness area. Where larger scale data could not be obtained, the National Atlas layer "National Wilderness Preservation System" was used as the data source. In its present form source data varies from a scale of 1:10000 to 1:2,000,000.</p>
