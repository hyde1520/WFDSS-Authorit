    <p class="bodytext">Provided here is a National merged dataset derived from each National Forest contribution. This data has been merged, dissolved, and erased of attributes contained in each original component dataset. For this purpose, specific attributes are not necessary, as any spatial areas depicted simply show areas where aerial fire retardant use is to be avoided as stated in USFS guidelines</p>
