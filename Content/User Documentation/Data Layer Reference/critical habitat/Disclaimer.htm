    <p class="bodytext">The GIS files and their associated coordinates are not the legal source for determining the critical habitat boundaries of species described within this data set. Inherent in any data set used to develop graphical representations, are limitations of accuracy as determined by, among others, the source, scale, and resolution of the data. While the Service makes every effort to represent the critical habitat shown with these data as completely and accurately as possible (given existing time and resource constraints), the USFWS gives no warranty, expressed or implied, as to the accuracy, reliability, or completeness of these data. In addition, the USFWS shall not be held liable for improper or incorrect use of the data described and/or contained herein. Graphical representations provided by the use of these data do not represent a legal description of the critical habitat boundary. The user is referred to the critical habitat textual description in the appropriate final rule for this species as published in the Federal Register. These data are to be used only in the context of the definition and purpose of critical habitat. This primarily relates to Section 7 consultation under the Endangered Species Act. These data may be used for planning and land management purposes. They are not to be used for legal survey use.</p>
