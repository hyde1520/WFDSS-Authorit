    <p class="bodytext">These data were obtained from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service’s Geospatial Services website. The critical habitat data on this site are maintained by the Environmental Conservation Online System (ECOS) Team. Only the polygon data were used in this data set. The line features, which are available from the aforementioned site, were not included. After the data were downloaded, they were re-projected to GCS NAD 83 to match the datum/projection of the other data layers in WFDSS.</p>
