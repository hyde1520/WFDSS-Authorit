    <h1 class="heading1">Data Input</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">This dataset was developed in partnership with the Conservation Biology Institute (CBI), whose efforts are closely aligned with the work of United States Geological Service (USGS) GAP Analysis Program (GAP) and the IUCN World Commission on Protected Areas. These organizations have developed valuable geospatial datasets that provide the most comprehensive collection of U.S. public lands protection and management data in the nation. Both the CBI Protected Areas Database (CBI PAD) and the GAP Analysis Program (GAP) Management Status Classification provide the foundation for collecting, mapping, and managing information on this measure. This dataset builds on the work of these organizations by using data they have created and maintaining the standards they have set, while adding new layers of information that more directly meets TNCs needs to measure and track the status and progress of biodiversity conservation.</p>
