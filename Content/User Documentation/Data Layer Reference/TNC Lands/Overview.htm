    <h1 class="heading1">Overview</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">This dataset is a spatial dataset of public and private lands and waters secured by a conservation situation that includes an explicit level of security from future conversion and current incompatible uses. Includes spatial data from TNC's Conservation Lands System (CLS) database, which is the legal database of record for all TNC land transactions (fee, easement, lease and deed restrictions). </p>
    <p class="bodytext">Conservation Management Status (CMS) is a measure derived from the intent, duration and the effective management potential of spatial features of interest ("conservation situations") in the dataset. It is defined as a measure of the likelihood that an existing conservation situation is sufficient to secure biodiversity and allow for its persistence. </p>
