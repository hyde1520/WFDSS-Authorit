    <p class="bodytext">The NPS buildings data are collected by individual NPS units and populated in the NPS FMSS database. If a building does not exist in the FMSS database, it does not appear in this layer. If a park did not include spatial data with their tabular data in FMSS, the building is not included in this layer. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">The FMSS data are compiled and processed at the NPS Resource Information Services Division (RISD) by joining the FMSS tabular data and the spatial data, and unnecessary attribute fields are reduced by NPS analysts. Attributes have been reduced from the original FMSS layer to include only the following: </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">construction type*</li>
      <li class="listbullet">square footage*</li>
      <li class="listbullet">historical status*</li>
      <li class="listbullet">current replacement value*</li>
      <li class="listbullet">park code</li>
      <li class="listbullet">FMSS building name*</li>
      <li class="listbullet">FMSSID - a unique identifier</li>
