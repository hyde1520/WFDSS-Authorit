    <h1 class="heading1">Data Limitations</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">The NPS has provided clear guidelines for collecting spatial data. FMSS data are collected separately with equally stringent standards for their collection. The data are then joined by GIS specialists at Park Units using a relational enterprise geodatabase template provided by NPS RISD. Additions or corrections to this layer can be made through the FMSS, which is then used to update this layer.</p>
