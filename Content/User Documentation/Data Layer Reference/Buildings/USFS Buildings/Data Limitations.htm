    <h1 class="heading1">Data Limitations</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Coordinate data entry in INFRA has not always been mandatory. Therefore, many buildings do not have spatial descriptors. In addition, of those buildings that do have spatial descriptors, not all of them have been verified and mistakes in data entry may have occurred. Additions or corrections to this layer can be made through the INFRA database, which can then be spatially enabled and used to update this layer.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Attributes for this layer included building name, type, and region it resides in. </p>
