    <p class="bodytext">The USDA FS buildings data are collected by individual USDA FS units and populated in the USDA FS INFRA database. If a building does not exist in the INFRA database, it does not appear in this layer. Each USDA FS region was queried individually. Latitude and Longitude data were used to create the shapefile. Buildings that were not within the region boundary in which it was populated from were not included in the layer. Then, all regions were merged to form a national layer.</p>
