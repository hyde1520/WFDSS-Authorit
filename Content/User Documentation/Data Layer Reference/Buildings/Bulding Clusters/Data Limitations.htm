    <p class="bodytext">Building cluster points approximate the location of one or more structures. Most building cluster points represent the center of parcels where county assessor records indicate taxable improvements are present, but may also represent structure point locations identified by county officials. Locational accuracy of cluster points decreases with large parcel areas. </p>

      <span class="emphasis"> Building Clusters points are intended for STRATEGIC USE ONLY. Always verify specific structure location with local knowledge.</span>
