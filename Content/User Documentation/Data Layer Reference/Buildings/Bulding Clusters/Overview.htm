    <p class="bodytext">The building clusters layer is being developed for use within WFDSS and undergoes continual improvements as county-level data become available. County structures data are derived from cadastral data provided by counties throughout the United States. These efforts are being coordinated through the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) Cadastral Subcommittee and the Wildland Fire Management RD&amp;A. </p>
