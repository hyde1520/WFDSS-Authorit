    <h1 class="heading1">Estimated Ground Evac Data Limitations</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">This dataset is to be used in planning and implementation phases of an active wildfire. This dataset is meant to quantify what many practitioners know qualitatively about the remoteness of many of the lands we manage. Our highest priority is to manage for the safety of the public and our firefighters. This dataset can help ensure that we have taken the proper steps to ensure a timely response should a serious accident occur. <span class="specialbold">These data are an estimate of the ground transport time to a fixed set of hospitals and should not be used for real-time route finding or specific evacuation routes.</span></p>
    <p class="bodytext">There is a known issue with these data surrounding large water bodies. Due to some discrepancies with the processing of the data there are frequently small polygons in the 6+-hour bin that typically appear to the north and east side of lakes/ponds/large water bodies. These polygons represent a slight limitation in the dataset and were determined to not have a significant negative effect on the intent of the dataset. These polygons are a known limitation and will be addressed in future data updates.</p>
