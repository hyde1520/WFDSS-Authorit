    <h1 class="heading1">Estimated Ground Evac Time Overview</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">This layer contains the estimated ground transport time in hours from every point within the Continental United States (CONUS) to a definitive care facility (hospital). This data includes both walking speeds when traveling off-road and driving speeds according to the speed limit of the roads traveled. The intent of this layer is to initiate discussions regarding Agency Administrator risk tolerance and mitigation as it pertains to firefighter safety at the earliest possible opportunity in the decision making process. It is not intended to automatically deter resource deployment to any location, but to encourage thoughtful decisions about the risks being transferred to firefighters and how to mitigate those risks. This layer contains several assumptions including, but not limited to, the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">The estimate does not include the time it might take to get critical care resources to the injured employee or the time to stabilize and package the employee for transportation.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">The travel time estimate is from the moment a litter is lifted off the ground and travel begins.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">The estimate does not address the fitness of the litter crew and their ability to maintain a constant rate of travel.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">It assumes a constant rate of speed and does not account for stops for patient care or litter crew handoffs.</li>
      <li class="listbullet"> It assumes an ambulance or similar mode of vehicle transportation is waiting at the closest point on a road from the injury location to begin driving immediately.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">It uses estimated rates of travel across various topography and the covering fuels.<br /></li>
    </ul>
