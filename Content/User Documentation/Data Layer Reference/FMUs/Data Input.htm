    <h1 class="heading1">Data Input</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">This data set is a compilation of FMU data provided by individual field units of the Bureau of indian Affairs, Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, US Fish and Wildlife Service, and the USDA Forest Service. The data must follow the pre-established data standard, which can be found at <a href="https://wfdss.usgs.gov/wfdss/pdfs/geospatial_data_stnd.pdf">https://wfdss.usgs.gov/wfdss/pdfs/Geospatial_data_stnd.pdf</a>. To provide continuity between the data submitted by each agency/unit and this final data set, no topological analysis or editing of the polygons was performed. Polygons were converted from multipart to singlepart due to increase performance with querying and analysis of the data in the ArcGIS Server environment.</p>
