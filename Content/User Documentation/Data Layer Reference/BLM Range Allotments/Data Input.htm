    <p class="bodytext">The BLM Allotments data were obtained from the GeoCommunicator GIS Web Service. Below are the details of this data set as it appears in the service:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <span class="specialbold">Service Name: </span>BLM_FEATURE_RANGELAND</li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <span class="specialbold">Feature Class Name: </span>Allotments</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">When downloading the data, the attribute field names are changed to generic vlaues. Therefore, the fields had to be renamed to match the web service and stay logical. No additional processing of the data was completed and they appear in WFDSS identical to the way they do in GeoCommunicator.</p>
