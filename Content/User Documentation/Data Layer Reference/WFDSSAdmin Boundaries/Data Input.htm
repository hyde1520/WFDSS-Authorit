    <p class="bodytext">The source data for this layer were collected from each of the five federal fire management agencies.  Minor processing steps were completed to each of the source layers to ensure a consistent projection/datum and attribution.  These edits did not impact the original integrity of the data and no polygons or associated attributes were changed, removed, or edited. For the purposed of mapping each agency dataset is displayed as it's own layer within WFDSS.</p>
