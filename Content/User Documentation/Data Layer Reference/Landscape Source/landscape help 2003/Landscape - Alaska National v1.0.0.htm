    <h1 class="heading1">Landscape - Alaska National v1.0.0</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Alaska National v1.0.0 has an imagery date and disturbance circa 2000-2001, similar to LANDFIRE National v1.0.0. Surface fuel models for Alaska were assigned by fire behavior and fuels experts based on existing vegetation types (EVT) descriptions and representative photos. Either the standard 13 fuel models (Anderson 1982) or 40 fire behavior fuel models (Scott and Burgan 2005) are available in Alaska National v1.0.0. To understand how LANDFIRE National v1.0.0, including Alaska, compares to other LANDFIRE data sets, go to <a href="https://www.landfire.gov/notifications.php">http://www.landfire.gov/version_comparison.php</a>.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">For canopy fuels, generally expect Alaska National v1.0.0 data to have the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">higher values for canopy cover greater than 70%, affecting dead fuel moisture conditioning and wind adjustment factors</li>
      <li class="listbullet">higher values for CBH</li>
      <li class="listbullet">lower values for CBD</li>
    </ul>
