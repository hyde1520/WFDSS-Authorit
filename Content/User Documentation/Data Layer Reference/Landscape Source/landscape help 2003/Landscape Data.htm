    <h1 class="heading1">Landscape Data</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">LANDFIRE National v1.0.0 was the first completed data set for the entire U.S. in 2009, including <a href="Alaska National v1.0.0.htm">Alaska</a> and <a href="">Hawaii</a>. All surface and canopy fuels information were based on satellite imagery dated from 1999-2003, including disturbance (large fires, beetle kill, management, etc.) as captured in the various imagery products. Calibration workshops were held from 2005 – 2009 across the country to verify and update the vegetation and fuel model selections for these data. However, in steeper areas or where shadows masked the satellite imagery, rock is not well represented. Further, in higher elevation areas, some areas that should have been rock were classified as meadows. Either the standard 13 fuel models (Anderson 1982) or 40 fire behavior fuel models (Scott and Burgan 2005) are available in LANDFIRE National v1.0.0. To understand how LANDFIRE National v1.0.0 compares to other LANDFIRE data sets, go to <a href="https://www.landfire.gov/version_comparison.php">http://www.landfire.gov/version_comparison.php</a>.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">For canopy fuels, generally expect LANDFIRE National v1.0.0 data to have the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">higher values for canopy cover greater than 70%, affecting dead fuel moisture conditioning and wind adjustment factors</li>
      <li class="listbullet">higher values for Canopy Base Height (CBH)</li>
      <li class="listbullet">lower values for Canopy Bulk Density (CBD)</li>
    </ul>
