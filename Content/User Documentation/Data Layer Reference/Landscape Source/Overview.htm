    <p class="bodytext">The Landscape Source data layer is generated "on-the-fly" in WFDSS and is based on one of two criteria:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">If this layer is turned on while viewing the <span class="emphasis">Intelligence Map,</span> it displays the coverage of the landscape data source that is set in the user's preferences from the My Home tab.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">When viewing this layer from the <span class="emphasis">Situation Map</span> within an incident, it displays the coverage of the landscape data source that is set on the Incident Information page.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">This layer is used as a reference-only layer in WFDSS, and is meant to serve as a double-check with the user to ensure that the appropriate landscape data source is selected.</p>
