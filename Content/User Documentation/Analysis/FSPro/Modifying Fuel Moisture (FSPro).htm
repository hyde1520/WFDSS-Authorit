    <p class="bodytext">When needed, Fire Behavior Specialists modify fuel moistures in FSPro as part of the overall calibration process. ERC values are used as a surrogate for fuel moistures in FSPro and each ERC bin is assigned both dead and live fuel moisture values. In most instances, you will not need to make changes to the NFDRS calculated dead fuel moistures but the values should always be verified and adjusted if needed or another station investigated for use. Live fuel moistures are calculated using the <a href="../../../Glossary Terms/growing season index (GSI).htm">Growing Season Index (GSI)</a>.  Though GSI generally produces  live fuel moistures that are fairly close to reality, they too should be evaluated and adjusted as necessary. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">You can obtain current live herbaceous and live woody fuel moisture values from field-sampled data, WFAS greenness maps, the national fuel moisture sampling database, or other methods. Default GSI live fuel moistures values may need to be updated on the ERC classes page to reflect current seasonal values. You will input the most current live fuel moisture values in the bin that contains the current ERC for the selected weather station and you will redistribute the values in the bins above to generally be lower values and the bins below to generally be higher values.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">FSPro is a long term modeling system and its important to remember that a long term analysis may cross multiple stages of plant development. As a result, select fuel moistures with care. No fuel moisture conditioning occurs with the FSPro simulation model therefore, fuel moistures are static for all fuel models and aspects for each iteration of the simulation, based on the ERC bin being modeled.</p>
