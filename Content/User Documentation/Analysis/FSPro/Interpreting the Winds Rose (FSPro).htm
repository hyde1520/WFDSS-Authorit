    <p class="bodytext">Fire Behavior Specialists may view the Wind Rose to visually inspect wind speeds, directions, and weights and confirm that they represent winds expected to affect the fire area for the current analysis. It is a good idea to view the Wind Rose for every FSPro run. Sometimes, an analyst will see an unusual wind direction or alignment that is more difficult to discern from the matrix. Basic information on how to interpret wind roses is readily available on the web.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">The Wind Rose is also helpful when comparing different options for the matrix, such as deciding which RAWS to select, whether wind gusts should be included, or effects of changing the Start/End hour filters. For most people, looking at the various wind roses makes comparisons easier. Wind Roses are viewed in a pop-up window; if the matrix is changed and the Wind Rose button is clicked again, the first Wind Rose is over-written. To compare several Wind Roses, analysts must keep the images using a screen capture program or use the browser window controls to print.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Fire Behavior Specialists can view the Wind Rose for the wind matrix that is visible on the FSPro Winds screen. You must generate an initial matrix by clicking Generate Wind Matrix before the Wind Rose button is active. Winds do not need to be Saved prior to viewing the Wind Rose, as the Wind Rose is simply a visual representation of what is in the matrix. The matrix shows the range and probability of wind speeds and directions that will be used in the FSPro analysis. The wind rose depicts the frequency of winds blowing from a particular direction. Parameters used to construct the Wind Rose are taken from the FSPro Winds page and listed on the image. </p>
