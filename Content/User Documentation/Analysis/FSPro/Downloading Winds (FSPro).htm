    <p class="bodytext">Fire Behavior Specialists can download selected wind data to their workstations before or after an FSPro analysis has been run. Download Winds is available from the FSPro Winds Menu Option. Wind data are downloaded in .csv file format .</p>
    <p class="bodytext">The wind data includes the entire historic record of hourly wind observations for the chosen RAWS. No matter how you set the Time Filter or Wind Type, the .csv file includes the entire wind record for that station (all hours, days, years). You do not need to click <span class="buttons">Generate Wind Matrix</span> for the download to begin. You can open the .csv file in Microsoft Excel or import it into Fire Family Plus (FFP) (software program available at <a href="http://www.fire.org">www.fire.org</a>) to take advantage of FFP's powerful weather analysis capabilities.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Analysts download wind data to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">evaluate the data in FFP to check for erroneous data that can affect the analysis,</li>
      <li class="listbullet">evaluate whether the station is a good choice for the analysis, or</li>
      <li class="listbullet">see if large portions of the record are missing data values that may affect the analysis.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">For example, if the record shows the windspeed at 180 degrees for every hour over an entire year, it may mean that the sensor was malfunctioning and the FSPro wind matrix will show a higher probability of southerly winds than should be expected. Analysts can compare two RAWS to see which might better represent winds based on local knowledge of the fire area. Finally, FFP allows users to see data counts that indicate whether large portions of the record are missing. Even if the Time Filter suggests data exist from 2007 to 2011, there is no way to know if years 2008, 2009, and 2010 are missing unless the data are examined. FSPro does not require a minimum number of data years for wind as it does for ERC.</p>
