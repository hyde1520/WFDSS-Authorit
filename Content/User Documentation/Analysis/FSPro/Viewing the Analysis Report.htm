    <p class="bodytext">The analysis report is a valuable resource to analysts, as well as to users who want to further document a given analysis. The analysis report can give insight into why particular inputs were used, as well as what the limitations and assumptions were for a particular analysis. It also helps clarify how an analysis result was obtained. This information is especially valuable as conditions and personnel change over the course of an extended incident. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">The Analysis Report is available for all fire behavior analyses and displays the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Incident Information</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Analysis Information </li>
      <li class="listbullet">RAWSinformation</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Weather observations used fordead fuelfor weather and wind streams</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Landscape information (including landscape editor rules)</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Notes saved by the analyst</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">FSPro reports display the following additional information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">FSPro Results (Fire Sizes and Histogram)</li>
      <li class="listbullet">FSPro ERC Classes information (RAWS used for ERCinformation, filter, classes and ERC Percentiles)</li>
      <li class="listbullet">FSPro ERC Stream and weather forecast data</li>
      <li class="listbullet">FSPro Winds (RAWS used for winds, filter, wind matrix. and windrose)</li>
