    <h1 class="heading1">FSPro - What it is and Why use it ?</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">FSPro is a geospatial probabilistic model that predicts fire growth, and is designed to support long-term decision-making (more than 5 days). </p>
    <p class="bodytext">FSPro calculates two-dimensional fire growth and maps the probability that fire will visit each point (cell) on the landscape of interest under the following conditions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">during the specified time</li>
      <li class="listbullet">in the absence of suppression</li>
      <li class="listbullet">based on the current fire perimeter or ignition point</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">FSPro currently has limited ability to model suppression effects.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">FSPro is potentially valuable to fire managers because it can help address uncertainty in long-term fire behavior analysis where weather forecasts are unreliable. It can help support risk-based decision making when the results are combined with information about resources and assets (values to be protected).  FSPro can provide insight for strategic decision-making by helping answering questions such as the following: </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">What is the probability a fire will reach apoint of concernon the landscape during a specific period of time (such as within 7, 10, 14 or moredays)?</li>
      <li class="listbullet">What is the probability that a fire will reach an administrative boundary during a specific period of time?</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Which fires or segments of fireswill likely need suppression action?</li>
      <li class="listbullet">How large might the fire get?</li>
      <li class="listbullet">What is the expected fire size distribution?</li>
      <li class="listbullet">How soon might the fire reach critical points of concern? (beta version [in testing])</li>
    </ul>
