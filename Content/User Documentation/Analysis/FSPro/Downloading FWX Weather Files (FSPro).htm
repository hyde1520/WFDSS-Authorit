    <p class="bodytext">Fire Behavior Specialists can download selected <a href="">FWX weather files</a> to their workstations before or after an FSPro analysis has been run. Downloading is available from the FSPro Information Menu Option.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">FWX files are fixed field text files that contain once-daily weather data for a chosen RAWS. The FWX file you can download contains historic weather data through the current date, and include all data years in the record (regardless of what dates are selected in the date filter). Data can be viewed as a text file, but are usually imported into the Fire Family Plus (FFP) software program (available at <a href="http://www.fire.org">www.fire.org</a>) to take advantage of FFP's powerful weather analysis capabilities. For more information about working with FWX files, refer to the <a href="http://www.firemodels.org/downloads/firefamilyplus/3.0.5/ffp_v3_user_guide.pdf">FFP user guide</a>.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">
      <span class="specialbold">Analysts download FWX files to:</span>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">evaluate the RAWS data in Fire Family Plus (FFP) to check for erroneous weather data,</li>
      <li class="listbullet">evaluate whether the station is a good choice for the analysis, or </li>
      <li class="listbullet">see if large portions of the record are missing data values that may affect the FSPro analysis. </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">For example, if the record contains an erroneous rainfall amount of 200 inches instead of 0.2 inches, it will artificially inflate the 10-hour and 1-hour Time Lag Fuel Moistures. Analysts can compare the temperatures for two stations during the month of interest to see which is more representative of temperatures observed on the fire for a specific time period. Finally, FFP allows users to see data counts that indicate whether large portions of the record are missing; FSPro needs 10 years of data for the ERC Percentiles, but even if a station shows a data record from 2001-2010, there may be no data for years 2007, 2008, and 2009 and it would be impossible to know this without checking the data. </p>
