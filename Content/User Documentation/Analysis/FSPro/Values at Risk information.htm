    <h1 class="heading1">Values at Risk information</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Values at Risk (VAR) information can be obtained for FSPro runs in WFDSS. VAR is a product of the FSPro output and is a quick way to view values information for ongoing fires. Values at Risk information is automatically generated for runs accepted as 'complete', or manually for other runs by clicking the Values at Risk Inventory link in the LayerSwitcher. Fire Behavior Specialists can view the VAR for any FSPro run with results, but other user roles can only view the VAR for runs once they have been accepted as 'complete' or if they've been assigned analysis editing or viewing privileges.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">The VAR window appears and displays the Values at Risk (as CURRENTLY exist in the WFDSS database) by each FSPro probability class. In the example below, communication towers exist in the 80-100%, 60-79%, 20-39%, 5-19% and .2-4.9% burn probability contours, but not in the 40-59% or &lt;.2% burn probability contours. There are roads in all of burn probability contours but only USFWS local trails in the 5-19% and .2-4.9% burn probability contours. The second table (Currency/Coverage of Values Queried that Produced Results) gives information about the GIS layers in the VAR database, their data source, currency date, and the extent of the coverage. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">The example below displays the communication tower layer is valid nationally as of August 2010. The third table (Currency/Coverage of Values Queried that Produced No Results) gives information about the GIS layers in the VAR database that were queried but do not exist within the FSPro output extent, their data source, currency date, and extent of the coverage.</p>

    <p class="note">
      <span class="specialbold">Note</span>: The VAR database is not likely to be completely up-to-date. Therefore, it is likely NOT all-inclusive. Users of the VAR information should check the currency/coverage of values queried tables for currency information.</p>
