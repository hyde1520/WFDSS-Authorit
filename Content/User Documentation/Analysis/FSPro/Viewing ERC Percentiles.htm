    <p class="bodytext">The complete ERC percentile list is available after you generate ERC Classes. The list includes the ERCs and the corresponding 1 hour, 10 hour, 100 hour, 1000 hour, live herbaceous and live woody fuel moistures for each percentile. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">Percentile ranking is based on the historic ERCs for the dates during the years you have selected in the Date Filter, listed above the table. Repeated ERC values indicate that this ERC occurred more than 1 percent of the days. Fuel moistures are the average fuel moisture for days with the corresponding ERC. Percentile ERC can help you modify the ERC bins used for the ERC classes, including the minimum ERC that supports fire movement.</p>
