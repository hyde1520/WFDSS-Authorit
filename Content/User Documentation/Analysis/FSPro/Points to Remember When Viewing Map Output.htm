    <h1 class="heading1">Points to Remember When Viewing Map Output</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Remember the following FSPro facts, assumptions, and limitations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">As with all models, quality of the outputs are limited by the validity of the inputs used.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <p>None of the inputs will be exactly perfect for a given fire situation. It is critical that the fire behavior specialist running FSPro is provided good information and guidance from a local subject matter expert for the following data:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="listbullet2">representative RAWS for weather and wind inputs</li>
          <li class="listbullet2">live fuel moisture and burning period information</li>
          <li class="listbullet2">fuel model information for landscape modification (if needed)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="listbullet">Even though an FSPro analysis can be set up and run relatively quickly, careful preparation and model calibration will provide much better results for insightful information to support wildland fire management and decision-making.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">FSPro has limited fine-scale temporal variability in weather (only one set of wind/fuel moisture conditions is used for each day of fire growth)</li>
    </ul>
