    <p class="bodytext">A Fire Behavior Specialist or Super Analsyt must select a weather station to generate the wind matrix, an input required by the FSPRo model to run. The two most important considerations for selecting a weather station that generates a wind matrix are the:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Time filter, and</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Station citing in relation to the local topography and how it influences the recorded winds.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">Select a station that best represents the winds influence for the fire area over its historical record and period of interest. For example, is the station located on a ridge top or valley bottom? Typically, data from weather stations located in valley bottoms reflect up-valley down-valley winds, while ridge-top stations will typically capture winds from 360 degrees, but of generally higher speeds. A station located in a north-south oriented valley bottom which captures only up-valley and down-valley winds will not be appropriate if the winds of concern are primarily from the west/southwest. If needed, you can <a href="Setting up FSPro Winds.htm">modify winds</a>.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">The drop-down list of available stations contains only remote automated weather stations (RAWS). The closest station (based on a formula for distance and elevation) that is currently reporting observations will display as the default station in the dropdown list. To be included in the list of stations available for generating a wind matrix, a station must:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Be a cataloged NFDRS weather station,</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Be active and collecting data in WIMS, and </li>
      <li class="listbullet">Have hourly wind information for both the ten-minute average winds and gusts.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">In all cases, wind speeds of 90 mph are filtered out and not used when developing the winds distribution tables and winds roses.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Ask local fire personnel for their input on station selection, view station information and data in Fire Family Plus, or contact the GACC meteorologist for information regarding weather station selection applicability. After you select a weather station for winds, click Notes from the left-side menu list and document why you chose that particular station.</p>
