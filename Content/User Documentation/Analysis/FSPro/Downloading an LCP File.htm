    <p class="bodytext">After you have created a landscape file (LCP) for your analysis, you can download it to your hard drive or network.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Occasionally, a Fire Behavior Specialist might want to download an LCP for use in models outside of WFDSS. Some desktop versions of the fire behavior models within WFDSS have features that are not included in the WFDSS versions. When downloading an LCP, make sure the parameters are correct for the modeling you want to do. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">Before downloading the LCP, verify the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Landscape is of a sufficient size.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Correct fuel model series is selected.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Resolution is set at the desired value. </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">If you change any of these parameters, you must re-create the landscape before you can download it. </p>
    <p class="warning">
      <span class="specialbold">CAUTION:</span> LCPs downloaded from WFDSS use a custom Albers conic projection. This custom projection could be problematic if you have vector files in other projections that you want to view with the LCP. To mitigate this problem, use the Landfire Data Access Tool (LFDAT) to dismantle the LCP into individual raster maps and re-project them with the projection (PRJ) file that was downloaded with the LCP. Alternatively, re-project the vector files using the PRJ file that was downloaded with the LCP. </p>
