    <p class="bodytext">Values at Risk (VAR) are generated automatically for FSPro runs accepted as 'complete' and manually for other runs by clicking the VAR Inventory link in the LayerSwitcher. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">VAR for any completed run (review or complete status) can be viewed by Fire Behavior Specialists. However, other user roles can only view VAR once a run has been accepted as complete, or if the user has been given analysis editing or viewing privileges. </p>
