    <p class="bodytext">WFDSS provides powerful fire behavior modeling tools. These tools help you predict where the fire will go next so that you can plan your management strategy accordingly.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">The more complex fire behavior modeling tools require the assistance of a Fire Behavior Specialist. However, Dispatchers, Authors, and Editors can run automated Basic Fire Behavior and Short-Term Fire Behavior on their incidents.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Unless you have filtered them out, the Analysis List page displays the status of all fire behavior analyses, these include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">
