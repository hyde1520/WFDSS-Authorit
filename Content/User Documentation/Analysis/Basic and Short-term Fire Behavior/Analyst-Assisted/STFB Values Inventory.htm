    <h1 class="heading1">STFB Values Inventory</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">It is fairly easy to obtain values inventory information associated with a Short-term Fire Behavior (STFB) analysis. When you make a Values Inventory request, WFDSS uses the STFB Arrival Time footprint to query a values inventory database. It then displays the values that are within the STFB Arrival Time grid, as well as what database layers were queried but no data were found within the area affected.</p>
    <p class="warning">
      <span class="specialbold">CAUTION:</span>  Do NOT assume that the data layers are complete or all-inclusive! The layers available in the values inventory are updated frequently as new information becomes available. In addition, new value layers are periodically being added to the database.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">To access the Values Inventory associated with a Short-Term Fire Behavior (STFB) analysis, see <a href="../../Obtaining a Values Inventory.htm">Obtaining a Values Inventory</a>.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Three tables appear on the Values Inventory page:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Basic information about the analysis</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Values found within the area covered by the STFB Arrival Time Grid (category, value, data source, as well as currency and coverage of the layers)</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Currency and coverage of values layers that were queried, but for which no results were found within the STFB footprint.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">Even though this Values Inventory information is not totally complete and is still a work in progress, it will evolve and improve over time.  In the interim, it can provide some useful information for wildland fire decision support.</p>
