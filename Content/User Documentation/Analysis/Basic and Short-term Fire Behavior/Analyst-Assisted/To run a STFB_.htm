    <h1 class="heading1">To run a STFB:</h1>
    <ol>
      <li class="listnumber">From the Incident list, select the incident for which you want to run a STFB.</li>
      <li class="listnumber">Click <span class="buttons">View Analyses</span>. The Analysis List appears for the selected incident.</li>
      <li class="listnumber">Under New Analysis, select Short-Term, then click <span class="buttons">Create Analysis for Incident</span>. The New Short-Term Analysis page appears.</li>
      <li class="listnumber">Enter an Analysis Name. <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../01a_Common User Content/Topic Snippets/Analysis Name Limitations.flsnp" /><div class="listcontinue"><p>Since incidents can have many analyses associated with them, be specific in your name (up to 48 characters). For example, "RedValley STFB 06152009 1300 jdoe" would be the Red Valley fire, STFB run on June 15, 2009 at 1 pm by John Doe.</p></div></li>

        <p>Set the date and hours. (The Hour field is the time at which fuels conditioning will stop.)</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="listbullet2">For dates in the future, WFDSS uses forecast data.</li>
          <li class="listbullet2">For dates in the past, WFDSS uses historic RAWS data.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="listnumber">Set the conditioning days. Five days is usually adequate since only 1-, 10-, and 100-hour timelag fuels are conditioned.</li>
      <li class="listnumber">Set the burn period (hours per period) and number of periods.</li>
      <li class="listnumber">
        <p>Set the foliar moisture content and select a crown fire method.</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="listbullet2">The default foliar moisture is usually adequate for an average fire season, but you might want to change it during a drought or if an insect/disease episode is occurring.</li>
          <li class="listbullet2">For recent versions of Landfire (2010, 2014) the canopy fuel values for CBD were computed to produce more active crown fire when using the Scott and Reinhardt compared to the Finney crown fire model. You would expect to see slower ROS and less fire intensity for predicted passive crown fire when using Finney versus Scott and Reinhardt crown fire models. However, the final selection of a crown fire model should be based on calibration to observed fire behavior. </li>
