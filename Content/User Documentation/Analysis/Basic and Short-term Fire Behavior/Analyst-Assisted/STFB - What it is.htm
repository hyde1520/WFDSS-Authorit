    <h1 class="heading1">STFB - What it is</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">WFDSS Short-Term Fire Behavior (STFB) is a two-dimensional fire growth model and is similar to the FlamMap's Minimum Travel Time (MTT), which is a desktop application. STFB is a web-based application that calculates spread rates and maximum spread direction at each cell.  Holding all environmental conditions (wind and fuel moistures) constant for the duration of the simulation, STFB calculates fire growth and behavior by searching for the set of pathways with minimum fire spread times from an ignition (point, line, or polygon) source.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Using one set of wind and fuel moisture conditions, STFB provides potential fire spread (arrival times and major paths) for a user-defined length of time.</p>
