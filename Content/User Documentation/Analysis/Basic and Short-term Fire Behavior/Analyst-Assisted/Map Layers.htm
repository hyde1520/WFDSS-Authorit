    <p class="note">
      <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../../01_Common Content/Notes, Cautions, Warnings/map layers zoom and in sys prefs.flsnp" /> If the layer you want to use doesn't appear in the layer list, make sure you've selected it in your <a href="../../../Home_User Profile/Changing Your System Preferences.htm">system preferences</a>. If you don't see anything change on the map when you turn on a layer, try zooming in. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">The following map layers are available from each map display in WFDSS. When you click the Map tab and the + next to each item (to expand them), you can view the individual layers contained by each.  You can turn off map layers, as needed, to only display the map layers you choose to view. This can be done on from <span class="menuoptions">My Home</span> &gt; <span class="menuoptions">System Preferences.</span></p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <span class="specialbold">Base layers: </span>Each layer type provides different information. For instance, WFDSS and USGS topos display the normal topographic maps that we're all familiar with. USGS Imagery and Google Maps are good for determining where forested areas exist. USGS Topo and Google Physical show shaded relief, as well as contour lines. USGS Imagery Topo shows a combination of imagery and contour lines. U.S. States is helpful when you are managing a large incident that crosses state lines.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <span class="specialbold">Fire Environment and Safety layers: </span>These layers can supply very useful information regarding the fire area. For example, you can view the locations of nearby incidents (based on the radius setting in a user's System Preferences) and nationally, or view planning areas for active incidents, active MODIS,VIIRS and retardant avoidance areas, if they exist. These layers can all provide valuable situational awareness. </li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <span class="specialbold">Disturbance Historylayers: </span>These layers contain fires since January 1 of the current year, as well as Historical Wildfires and Fuel Treatments.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <span class="specialbold">Fire Weather and Danger layers: </span>These layers contain fire weather zone boundaries and locations of RAWS.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <span class="specialbold">Boundaries layers: </span>Use this layer to determine land ownership in the area of a fire, as well as jurisdictional and responsible agencies and counties. You can also determine if the default LANDFIRE Landscape Source selected the incident (chosen on the Incident Information page) provides coverage for the incident area.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <span class="specialbold">Designated Areas layers: </span>These layers are useful if you are managing an incident in an area that isremote or receives heavy recreation use, or near trails, rivers and/or byways of national significance. You might have to zoom in to see the layer.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <span class="specialbold">Infrastructure layers:</span> These layers contain spatial information about facilities/buildings, communications, energy and roads/trails. Depending on what map layers you selected in your <a href="../../../Home_User Profile/Changing Your System Preferences.htm">System Preferences</a>, you may be able to view where transmission lines, power plants, electric sub stations,oil/gas pipelines, roads,as well as some structures exist in your area of interest.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <span class="specialbold">National and Cultural Resources layers:</span> These layers contain air quality spatial information that includes Class 1 Air Sheds and NAA ozone and particulates as well as critical habitat, and other species. Keep in mind that the Critical Habitat layer is not completefor the entire country. <span class="emphasis">Therefore, just because nothing shows up, that does notmean there is no critical habitat in your area. It might only indicate that no critical habitat layer exists in WFDSS for your fire's area.</span></li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <span class="specialbold">Unit Fire Planning: This layer is scale dependent and lists the units with boundaries that</span>intersect the current map display; zoom in to see fewer units, or zoom out to see more. For each unit listed, you can also view the unit's associated outline, FMUs and or SOs, Management Requirements (if the unit has chosen to implement the Spatial Fire Planning Process) and Other Unit Shapes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">If you are viewing the Situation, Analysis, Results, or View Landscape maps, you also see the Incident and Analysis layers. These layers contain:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <p>
          <span class="specialbold">Incident layers:</span>You can create and save the following incident shapes: </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="listbullet2">Planning areas</li>
          <li class="listbullet2">Fire perimeters</li>
          <li class="listbullet2">Management action points</li>
          <li class="listbullet2">Incident obj. shapes</li>
          <li class="listbullet2">Points of interest</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <p>
          <span class="specialbold">Analysis layers: </span>You can create and save a variety of analysis shapes and view model outputs:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="listbullet2">Ignitions</li>
          <li class="listbullet2">Barriers</li>
          <li class="listbullet2">Landscape masks</li>
          <li class="listbullet2">Basic</li>
          <li class="listbullet2">Short-Term</li>
          <li class="listbullet2">Near-Term Results</li>
          <li class="listbullet2">FSPro Results</li>
          <li class="listbullet2">FSPro Suppression Results</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">Notice that some layers have little color palettes next to the layer name. When you click these, the legend for the layer appears. </p>
