    <p class="bodytext">WFDSS Short-Term Fire Behavior (STFB) was designed to be used by Fire Behavior Specialists (FBS) as a relatively quick way to get an idea of potential fire spread from an ignition (point, line, or polygon) using one set of wind and fuel moisture conditions for the user-defined burn period(s). </p>
    <p class="bodytext">The model retrieves forecasted weather and winds for the selected time, using National Weather Service (NWS) Forecast Data for current simulations. For historic fires, the model can use historic weather. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">The FBS can accept the fuel moisture, weather and wind inputs or replace those values as needed.  Within a short period of time (usually within a couple of minutes), WFDSS STFB fire spread results are ready for viewing. </p>
