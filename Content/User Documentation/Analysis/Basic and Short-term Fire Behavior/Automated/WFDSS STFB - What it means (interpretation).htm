    <h1 class="heading1">WFDSS STFB - What it means (interpretation)</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">WFDSS Short-Term Fire Behavior (STFB) output results are fairly straightforward to interpret. The following image shows an Automated STFB analysis with both Arrival Time and Major Paths displayed. The legend provides the inputs used for the analysis and describes the hours used for the Arrival Time output.  In this example, the legend displays the date and hours for the Arrival Time, as well as the Short-Term Fire Behavior Analysis Information.  The dark red lines depict the simulated fire's Major Paths.</p>

    <p class="bodytext">Although initial fuel moistures are conditioned prior to ignition and gridded winds are generated from the inputs, the outputs still represent just a single 'snapshot in time'. Weather conditions (wind, temperature, humidity, precipitation, etc.) do not change throughout the scenario and, although the fuels are conditioned to the start time, fuel moistures do not change over the course of the analysis, either.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">The MTT flow path results of an Automated STFB run represent only the influence of topography combined with the static (but gridded) wind speed and direction used in the inputs. If the influence of changing weather conditions over time is important for answering the question being asked, then consider locating an analyst to complete an Near Term Fire Behavior (NTFB) run.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">When interpreting these output results it is crucial to remember the numerous WFDSS Automated STFB Assumptions and Limitations.</p>
