    <h1 class="heading1">Weather Stream</h1>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">The Weather Stream section gives you 10 days of weather observations from the WFDSS-selected RAWS. The second to the last row of observations (July 17 in the example below) is the analysis start date and observations. The previous 7 days' (to the start date) observations were used for dead fuel moisture conditioning. The last date is the day after the analysis start date, as required by the model.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">If you have chosen a date in the past for which to run your analysis, archived weather is used. However, the more likely scenario is starting your analysis for a future date. When that is the case,National Digital Forecast Database (NDFD) values are used to calculate fuel moistures andfire behavior outputs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">Note: If you are in Alaska where NDFD data is not yet available, BFB and STFB analyses can only be run for dates in the past.</p>
