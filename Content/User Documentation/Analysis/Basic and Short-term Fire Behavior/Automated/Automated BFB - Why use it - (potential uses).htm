    <h1 class="heading1">Automated BFB - Why use it - (potential uses)</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Outputs from WFDSS Automated Basic Fire Behavior (BFB) have a variety of uses, including the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Fire behavior outputs (flame lengths, rates of spread, crown fire activity, etc.) can be calculated using forecasted weather and displayed in WFDSSAutomated BFB to provideinsight into expected fire behavior across the landscape extent for a chosen time (e.g., the peak of the burning period for the next afternoon).</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Using forecasted weather, landscape-wide 1-hour and 10-hour fuel moistures could be calculated for determining likelihood of successful burnout conditions.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Using archived (historic) wind and weather observations, WFDSSAutomated BFB calculations could be used for critiquing landscape fuels data by choosing a date and time of a 2008 fire that had recorded fire behavior observations.For example, theAutomated BFB Crown Fire Activity output could be compared to actual observations of crown fire activity for a given time and location.</li>
    </ul>
