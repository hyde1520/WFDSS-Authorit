    <h1 class="heading1">WFDSS STFB - Why use it - (potential uses)</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">The automated version of WFDSS Short-Term Fire Behavior (STFB) is a quick way to get an idea of potential fire spread from an ignition point using one set of wind and fuel moisture conditions for the user-defined burn period(s). Some potential uses of Automated STFB (given its many limitations) include the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <li class="listbullet2">Obtain insight into potential short-term fire spread times and locations using forecasted weather.</li>
        <li class="listbullet2">Get a rough idea of short-term fire spreadduring a forecasted wind event.</li>
        <li class="listbullet2">Run "what-if" scenarios for spot fires.</li>
        <li class="listbullet2">Run several days of fire spread to help determine the size and extent needed for the Planning Area for the WFDSS Decision Process.</li>
        <li class="listbullet2">Evaluate landscape and weather data using historic weather and fire perimeters.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
