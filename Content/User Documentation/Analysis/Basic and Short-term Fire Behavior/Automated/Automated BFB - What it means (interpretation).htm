    <h1 class="heading1">Automated BFB - What it means (interpretation)</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">WFDSS Basic Fire Behavior (BFB) output results are fairly straightforward to interpret. The output shows fire behavior as if the entire landscape burned at one instant in time under the wind conditions displayed in the wind grids. Though only a single wind speed and direction were input, the model adjusts these values according to the underlying terrain.When you choose a specific fire behavior output, BFB displays the calculated fire behavior characteristics for every cell of the landscape extent, based on the analysis start date and conditioning end time (start time). The image below shows an example of Automated BFB analysis with the Rate of Spread output displayed. You can easily switch the output units from meters to feet by clicking a link near the bottom of the legend.</p>

      <li class="listbullet">inputs used for the analysis, such as the Analysis Date and Time,Wind Speed and Direction, and RAWS Stationused</li>
      <li class="listbullet">resolution (in this case, 30 meters)</li>
      <li class="listbullet">units (in this case, meters per minute)</li>

      <li class="listbullet">frequency or number of cells in each value class.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">When interpreting these output results, it is crucial to remember the numerous WFDSS Automated BFB Assumptions and Limitations.</p>
