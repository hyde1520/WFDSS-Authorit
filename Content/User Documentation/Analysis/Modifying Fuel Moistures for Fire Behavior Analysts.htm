    <p class="bodytext">For BFB &amp; STFB, NTFB and FSPro analyses, Fire Behavior Specialists can modify the default fuel moistures for the fuel models on the landscape. Default dead fuel moisture are calculated using the standard NFDRS algorithms as implemented in WIMS and FireFamily Plus.  Default live herbaceous and woody fuel moistures are calculated using the <a href="../../Glossary Terms/growing season index (GSI).htm">Growing Season Index (GSI)</a>. For all analyses, dead fuel moisture is set to default NFDRS values for each cell on the landscape. When you use conditioning, dead fuel moisture is conditioned over time for each cell. Conditioning occurs up until the analysis start date for BFB and STFB. In NTFB, conditioning occurs until ignition, and then dead fuel moisture values continue to adjust throughout the analysis. No conditioning is used for FSPro. In most instances, you will not need to make changes to dead fuel moistures, but they should always be verified and adjusted if needed or another station investigated for use.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Live fuel moisture defaults generated by GSI are generally closer to reality than those produced by the NFDRS system. These values, however, are simply calculations to be used as a starting point and a surrogate value in the absence of known measured and sampled inputs.  Live fuel moisture defaults should be evaluated and adjusted against measured values and observed fire activity as appropriate.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Live fuel moistures <span class="emphasis">do not </span>change during conditioning and as a result, the fuel moistures shown are exactly what is used to calculate fire behavior: live fuel moisture values for all analyses are static across the landscape. Live fuel moisture values are important because the values used for an analysis determine the level of curing and the fraction of live fuel load that transfers to the 1-hour dead fuel for any dynamic fuel models on your landscape if using the Scott-Burgan 40 fuel models. The load transfer has a corresponding effect on fire behavior characteristics and in some cases, the change is dramatic.</p>
