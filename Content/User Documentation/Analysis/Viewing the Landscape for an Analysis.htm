Select each layer separately to view the effects on that layer. Above the mapping tools is a <a href="../01a_Common User Content/Map Features/Bookmarks/Bookmarking Maps.htm">Bookmark button</a> that allows Dispatchers, Authors, and Editors to save their current map settings on the Analysis map so they will be available the next time they login to WFDSS. There is also the option to share any bookmark as a link with other users whose privileges allow them to view the map context.</p>
