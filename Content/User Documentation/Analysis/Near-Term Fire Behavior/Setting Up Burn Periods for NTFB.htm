    <h1 class="heading1">Setting Up Burn Periods for NTFB<MadCap:keyword term="burn periods:NTFB" /><MadCap:keyword term="Near-Term Fire Behavior (NTFB):burn periods" /></h1>
    <p class="bodytext">The duration of modeled burning for each day of Near-Term Fire Behavior projection is known as the model's 'burn period'.  Each projection date in NTFB must have at least one burn period. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">The default burn period in NTFB is 24 hours; however, modeling a fire overnight is generally not advised. NTFB, like FARSITE, has a tendency to over-predict overnight fire spread. For this reason, most analysts shorten the duration that the modeled fire is allowed to burn each day. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">A good starting point for calibration is to estimate the hours that the real-world fire is actively spreading (with head and flanking fire), and then buffer that by an hour or two on each end. Doing so approximates the periods of slower burning and overnight backing fire growth. For example, If the fire you are modeling is actively burning (or anticipated to actively burn) from 1400 to 1800, a reasonable burn period for a first calibration run might be from 1300 to 1900.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Though it is not likely to be a common scenario, more than one burn period can be assigned for each day, if needed.</p>
