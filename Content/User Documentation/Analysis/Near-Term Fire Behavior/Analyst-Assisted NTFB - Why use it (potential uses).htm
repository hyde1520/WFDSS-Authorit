    <h1 class="heading1">Analyst-Assisted NTFB - Why use it (potential uses)</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">
      <span class="editorialcomments">&lt;As it was written for STFB this section was identical to the STFB 'what it means section' (and not at all on topic). This discussion does not match the STFB help section (but the STFB help section needs help!).  I would like to re-organize these sections in NT/ST and Basic this winter but do not hav time to do it now - Mitch; Kit: go for it!&gt;</span>

    <p class="bodytext">NTFB is particularly useful for modeling what a fire might do over the next several days under forecasted weather conditions. Unlike Short-Term Fire Behavior, NTFB can model a fire for wind and weather conditions that change over time. This is true for both the fire 'progression' outputs (Time of Arrival and Burn Period) and the fire behavior outputs (which are relegated to the modeled fire perimeter and not the entire landscape).</p>
    <p class="bodytext">NTFB outputs are represented as a modeled fire progression, and therefore, are easy to interpret and understand. In addition, NTFB is an excellent tool for analysts to calibrate future analyses (by modeling known fire spread under historic wind and weather conditions).</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Because NTFB relies on forecast data, the outputs are only as good as the forecast itself. For this reason, and because forecasts become less reliable over time, NTFB is best used for a period of around three days.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">If the user is trying to answer a 'what-if scenario' about a short duration weather event, STFB may be a more appropriate tool.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">If the user is concerned about the full range of possibilities (probabilities) of fire growth over a longer duration, FSPRO may be a more appropriate tool.</p>
