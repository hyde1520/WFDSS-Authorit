    <h1 class="heading1">NTFB - What it does (outputs)</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Using the analysis start date, WFDSS retrieves RAWS data for the user-defined number of days prior to ignition to complete fuel moisture conditioning (of dead fuels) for each cell of the landscape extent. The WFDSS Near-Term Fire Behavior (NTFB) then calculates fire behavior based on the user-defined inputs to create a modeled fire progression for the duration of the analysis.  Unlike Short Term Fire Behavior (STFB), the weather and wind inputs are used by the NTFB model as they change over time.</p>
