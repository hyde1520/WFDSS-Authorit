    <p class="bodytext">Several fire analysis tools are available in WFDSS, and these are intended to support fire management decisions. To view an analysis result before it is accepted by an analyst as complete, you must have privileges to view or edit an analysis. Once the analysis is accepted as complete, any WFDSS user can view the results.</p>
