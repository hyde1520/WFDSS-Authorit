    <h1 class="heading1">Creating an Analysis Note</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Fire Behavior Specialists and Incident Owners/Editors (that have been given analysis edit privileges) can add notes to analyses associated with their incidents. You can add notes to the following pages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Analysis Information (for all analyst assisted fire behavior models)</li>
      <li class="listbullet">ERC Classes, ERC Stream and Winds pages (FSPRO only)</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Analysis Results (map)</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Landscape (map)</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Landscape Editor</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">If you copy an analysis, the notes are also copied. You can add additional notes and edit or delete existing notes at any time. Text boxes have <a href="../../zzzz_Sandbox/5.3Release/Character Limitations.htm">character limits </a>which can be easily exceeded when copying formatted text from outside the application.</p>
