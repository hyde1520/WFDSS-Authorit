    <h1 class="heading1">Weather Station Availability for Fire Behavior Analysis</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">A variety of weather stations are available to provide data for the fire behavior analysis models in WFDSS and are generally within 1 degree of latitude and longitude of the entered incident latitude and longitude. The closest reporting station in terms of its distance from the incident latitude, longitude, and elevation will generally be the initial displayed station. The list of weather stations available for each model is dependent on the following shared criteria:  </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">The weather station must be active and currently reporting data to WIMS, and</li>
      <li class="listbullet">The weather station must be a cataloged NFDRS weather station.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">In addition, if a station manager has not updated a station in WIMS (entered manual state of the weather, etc.) for three days, the station may not be available in the drop-down list until those updates have been entered.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Individual models may have more stringent requirements and these should be taken into account when <a href="Selecting a Weather Station for Fire Behavior Analysis.htm">selecting a weather station for fire behavior analysis</a>. When running a fire behavior analysis and the weather station you are looking for is unavailable, refer to the list above to help you evaluate why the station may or may not be available for selection.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Weather station names containing an apostrophe ('), if used to generate Fire Danger Rating Graphs, were breaking links to the incident content tree within decision editors. This issue was remedied in the October 2019 release and is not expected to impact users into the future. Apostrophes will still display to users in the interface but under the hood, apostrophes have been removed.</p>
    <p class="note">
      <MadCap:snippetText src="../../01_Common Content/Notes, Cautions, Warnings/Topic6873.flsnp" /> The actual weather data available for an individual station is unique to each station. In FSPro, the number of years, months or days within a specific year that actual weather data exist cannot be determined in WFDSS. The months and actual days a station actively collects information is best determined outside the WFDSS system. Knowing this is important when setting the date/time filter's years and start and end months. The actual weather data available for an individual station is unique to each station.
