    <h1 class="heading1">Using the 5.2 Release with Different Browsers</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">The Default Decision Editor works best with IE 11, Chrome or Firefox. We are sorry for the inconvenience and are working to find a solution other than installing a newer version of IE or using Firefox and Chrome. Users can still use the Advanced Decision Editor, which is actually the same decision editor we have been using since 2009.</p>
