    <p class="bodytext">An incident owner or incident editor can create new reports that contain a variety of decision and/or incident content that a user selects. WFDSS offers three types of reports for users to create: </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Custom reports contain decision and/or incident content that a user selects.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <a href="../Incident/mgmt action points/Creating Management Action Point (M.A.P.) Reports.htm">Management Action Point Reports </a>contain one or more M.A.P.s and associated images, as well as any other decision and/or incident content a user wants to add.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <a href="../../zzzz_Sandbox/Diane/Creating Delegation of Authority Reports.htm">Delegation of Authority reports </a>that are developed based on a template you create, or copy from the list of available templates.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">Once a report is created, it is saved to the Reports List where it can be accessed for <a href="Editing Reports.htm">editing</a> and eventually <a href="Publishing a Report.htm">publishing</a>. Once published, report content is permanently locked and can be downloaded and printed. Report content that contains content not yet published in a decision can be be downloaded as a draft .PDF for viewing or sharing.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">If you need to modify the name of a report after its been created, you can do so by clicking View Information/History on the Decisions page.  The name of a report cannot be modified once it is published.</p>
