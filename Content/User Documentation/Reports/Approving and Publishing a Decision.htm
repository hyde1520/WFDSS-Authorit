    <h1 class="heading1">Approving and Publishing a Decision<MadCap:keyword term="decisions:publishing" /><MadCap:keyword term="decisions:approval:process" /></h1>
    <p class="bodytext">At least one decision Approver is required. Before a decision is published, all designated Approvers must approve the decision. Once all designated Approvers have approved the decision, the <span class="buttons">Publish Decision</span> button becomes available.  The Approver that publishes the decision also determines the number of days between periodic assessments (up to 14 days.)</p>
    <p class="bodytext">If multiple approvers are assigned and the last one approver is removed, one of the previous approvers must re-approve the decision and set the periodic assessment.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">If you are designated as the sole decision Approver, you receive an email when the decision is set to approve. If you are one of multiple Approvers, you may opt out of receiving the email so long as one Approver continues to receive it. An Approver can manage their email preference in two ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">By selecting/deselecting the appropriate checkbox when approving the decision, or</li>
      <li class="listbullet">By selecting/deselecting the Email box beside their name in the Incident Privileges.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">The email is helpful because it contains a hyperlink that allows an Approver to quickly navigate to the decision that needs approval.</p>
    <p class="note">
      <span class="specialbold">Note: </span>If necessary, you can bypass the review process and approve a decision even if it hasn't been reviewed yet. However, doing so locks out the reviewers.</p>
