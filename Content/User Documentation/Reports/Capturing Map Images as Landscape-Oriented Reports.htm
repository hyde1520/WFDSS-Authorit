    <h1 class="heading1">Capturing Map Images as Landscape-Oriented Reports<MadCap:keyword term="reports:Landscape" /></h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Users can generate quick landscape-oriented reports for images captured map displays. When you capture an image, you must name it and provide a brief description of what the image contains. If you provide a Report Name in addition, two things will occur when you click Capture Image:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">The image is saved to the Images folder in incident content for use in a decision, and</li>
      <li class="listbullet">A report with the name you chose is saved to the Reports tab. </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">Reports created this way are landscape-oriented and contain only the image you captured, unless  you choose to customize the report and add additional text or images. Reports are editable in WFDSS until published, but can be downloaded and shared as .pdfs at any time.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Landscape-oriented reports display larger map images than decisions (decisions are portrait-oriented) and can help you quickly share maps that contain timely and critical information like fire behavior analysis outputs, names and locations of M.A.P.s, etc.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">You can capture images without creating reports, but you can't create a report without also entering an image label and capturing the image.</p>
