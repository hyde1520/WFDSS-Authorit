    <p class="bodytext">Incident Owners can designate decision Reviewers for each incident. A decision Reviewer is not required, and users assigned Reviewer privileges do not have to review a decision before it can be approved and published.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">If you are designated as a decision Reviewer, you will receive an email when the decision is set to review. A Reviewer will not be able to access a decision for reviewing until they receive this automated email (which may take a few minutes from when a decision was submitted for review/approval). Until that point, the decision is not available for reviewing.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">After opening the email, click the link in the email. Otherwise, you can navigate to the decision manually. If you choose to navigate to a decision manually, from the Decisions page you can access the content for reviewing in two ways. You can select the pending decision, and then:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Click <span class="buttons">View Decision.</span></li>
      <li class="listbullet">Click <span class="buttons">Review/Approve Decision</span>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">Either option allows you to review decision content, but only the latter provides the option to <span class="buttons">Mark the Decision Reviewed</span> or <span class="buttons">Reject the Decision</span>. </p>
    <p class="warning">
      <span class="specialbold">CAUTION:</span> If the Incident Owner has a designated Reviewer(s), and even one Reviewer Returns the Decision for Edits, then the Incident Owner must correct the problem and re-submit the decision for review.</p>
