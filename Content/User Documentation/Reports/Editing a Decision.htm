    <p class="bodytext">Both decision editors allow multiple Owners or Editors to work on a decision simultaneously. This strategy is more efficient and helps a unit produce a decision document more quickly than if multiple users work together in one WFDSS account. Users can check out and edit a portion of the decision and check it back in when they are finished. Checked out portions of a decision can only be edited by the user that checked it out, to eliminate the risk of multiple editors ‘walking’ on each other. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">A decision consists of nine parts and you can select /check out the full pending decision for editing or just a section. Typically, it is best to just edit one section of a document at a time. This enables other users to edit other sections of the decision at the same time. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">When a decision or its sections show as Available in the status column, the decision and its parts are available for editing and are not checked out by Incident Owners or Editor.</p>
