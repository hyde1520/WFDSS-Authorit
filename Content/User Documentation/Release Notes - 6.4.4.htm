    </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">When the Push to IRWIN button is clicked, any updated information in WFDSS will be updated in IRWIN correctly.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">The Estimated Final Cost in IRWIN will be populated with the most recent published cost in WFDSS (the cost associated with the most recent published decision or periodic assessment validating that decision).</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Incidents received from IRWIN as Wildfires will continue exchanging data with IRWIN if their type is changed to Other. Wildfires created in WFDSS that change to type Other or Prescribed will continue to exchange data with IRWIN.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Users will no longer be able to modify or delete an Incident Group created from an IRWIN Complex. The Incident Group will maintain the list of Incidents within the IRWIN Complex when the complex is updated. </li>
      <li class="listbullet">Incidents that have been marked Certified in IRWIN can now be modified in WFDSS, though only for fields in which WFDSS has authority to write to, based on IRWIN authoritative source hierarchy.</li>

    <p class="heading4">
      <span class="specialbold">Enhancements Incident Information Page - IRWIN Information Section for National Editors</span>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">A checkbox has been added to allow a user to mark an Incident as Valid or Invalid in IRWIN.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Unselecting the 'Incident Quarantined in IRWIN' on an incident created in WFDSS will remove any potential conflict relationships.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">A 'Compare WFDSS and IRWIN Attributes' link has been added that will display a new popup window that shows the WFDSS Incident Information alongside its corresponding information in IRWIN. This feature will improve troubleshooting.</li>
