      <li class="listnumber">Click <span class="buttons">Assess Situation</span>. The Situation page appears embedded in the main application's window. An alternative method to opening the Situation map is to click the map icon located on the right side of the screen from any of the other tabs (Information, Objectives, Course of Action, Cost, Decisions, Periodic Assessment, or Reports); this option opens the Situation map in its own window and allows the greatest editing flexibility as you can develop decision inputs and view the map simultaneously.(It might take a few seconds for the map to load, depending on your Internet connection.)</li>
      <li class="listnumber">From the Map tab, select the data layers you want to display on the map.<div class="listnote"><p><MadCap:snippetText src="../../01_Common Content/Notes, Cautions, Warnings/note about + sign in layer tree.flsnp" /> If a + sign appears to the left of a data layer, you need to click the plus sign and select the sub-layers listed. The green + button at the right of a data layer indicates that you can create that layer (e.g., planning areas, fire perimeters,etc.)</p></div></li>
      <li class="listnumber">Check the map resolution, and use the Slider to adjust as needed.</li>
      <li class="listnumber">Click the Rectangle icon <img src="" alt="" width="0" height="0" vspace="0px" hspace="0px" align="Bottom" border="0px" /> to draw a planning area. (You must designate a planning area before you can document a decision.)</li>
      <li class="listnumber">Click the Landscape Extent icon <img src="" alt="" width="0" height="0" vspace="0px" hspace="0px" align="Bottom" border="0px" />to draw a landscape extent. (You must draw a landscape extent before you can run a fire behavior analysis.)</li>
