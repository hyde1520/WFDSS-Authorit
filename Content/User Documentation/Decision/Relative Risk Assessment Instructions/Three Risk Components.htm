    <h1 class="heading1">Three Risk Components</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">The relative risk assessment chart uses three risk components: </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">values</li>
      <li class="listbullet">hazard</li>
      <li class="listbullet">probability</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">Each of these components is assessed independently. Then, the three outputs are evaluated in a final step that provides the relative risk for the fire. Each risk component is defined by three variables. One variable is located on the right and one on the left side of the box and the third variable is defined by three interior lines extending from top to bottom.</p>
