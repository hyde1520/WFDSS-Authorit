    <p class="bodytext">Evaluate the potential for a long-duration fire and rank this element Low, Moderate or High. Time remaining until a season-ending event should be considered.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Time of Season is the current time in relationship to the historical or peak fire season. The graph reinforces the importance of time of season. During the early part of the fire season, the peak of burning activity is still to come, thus the fire could present substantial variation in behavior and activity. In the middle of the season, the peak of burning activity may or may not have occurred, while in the late part of the season, the peak of fire activity generally has already occurred and managers can reasonably expect diminishing fire activity and behavior as time progresses.</p>
