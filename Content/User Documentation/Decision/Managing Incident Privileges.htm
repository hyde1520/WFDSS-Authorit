    <h1 class="heading1">Managing Incident Privileges<MadCap:keyword term="privileges:incident" /><MadCap:keyword term="incidents :privileges (incident)" /></h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Incident Privileges are specific to each incident. From the Incident Privileges menu option, Incident Owner(s) assign and manage incident-level privileges for incidents they own. From this location, decision Approvers, if they are also incident Owners, can manage their preference with regard to system-generated, periodic assessment-related emails as well.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">
      <span class="specialbold">Incident Owners</span> can perform the following tasks from the Incident Privileges menu option:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Assign incident-level privileges (Edit, Review, Approve) to other WFDSS users.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Assign incident ownership to or share incident ownership with other WFDSS users or groups.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Query incident privileges and ownership for an incident to determine who has privileges and what types of privileges each user has.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Removeprivileges from WFDSS users who are no longer assigned to assistwith decision documentation for an incident.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Determine which Approvers will or will not receive periodic assessment reminder emails.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Opt out of the automated email option, if they choose NOT to receive emails when Periodic Assessments have been completed AND they choose not to receive emails when decisions are published for incidents that they own.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">When assigning privileges to a group (it may be helpful to <a href="../Home_User Profile/Creating a User Group.htm">create that group</a> if it hasn't already been created) in your personal WFDSS address book before you begin. Groups can help you quickly locate individuals you regularly work with on incidents.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">WFDSS automatically generates an email to individuals you assign privileges to, notifying them of the change. Emails are automatically generated for this purpose in both Training and Production.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">
      <span class="specialbold">Incident Approvers</span> can perform the following tasks from the Incident Privileges menu option, if they are Incident Owners:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Opt to receive/not receive WFDSS generated emails alerting them of due or overdue periodic assessments if more than one approver exists for an incident (they also have the opportunity to do this when they approve a decision).</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Determine who has incident-level privileges for an incident and make edits as necessary.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">When an Incident Owner assigns additional owners, the email box will automatically be checked beside the Owner's name. This indicates that the Owner will be opted in to receive emails when periodic assessments have been completed and when decisions are published. Owners can uncheck the box if they choose to opt out of this option.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">When an Incident Owner assigns one or more approvers, the Email box will automatically be checked beside the selected Approver's name (as well as the Edit privilege). This indicates that the Approver(s) will receive an email alerting them that the periodic assessment is due or overdue. This feature is not enabled in Training, as Approvers are not alerted of due or overdue assessments in this system.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">At least one Approver must receive the email, but other Approvers can opt out, as mentioned above. WFDSS will not allow all Approvers for an incident to opt out of receiving the email; WFDSS will 'reset' the incident overnight and automatically select each Approver to receive the email.</p>
    <p class="heading2">Edit, Review and Approve Privileges</p>
    <p class="bodytext">An Incident Owner can grant Edit, Review, and Approve incident privileges to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Any WFDSS user assigned any user role, and</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Groups of WFDSS users that you create in your personal WFDSS address book.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">The following is a breakdown of each privilege:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <span class="specialbold">Edit:</span> Allows users to edit content in a decision document, as well as <a href="http://wfdss.usgs.gov/wfdss_help/WFDSSHelp_upload_shapes.html">upload shapes </a>and <a href="../01a_Common User Content/Map Features/Uploading Images.htm">images.</a></li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <span class="specialbold">Review:</span> Allows users to <a href="../Reports/Reviewing a Decision.htm">review</a> the content of the decision document and either mark the decision Reviewed or return the decision for edits. Reviewers are not required, but are recommended.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <span class="specialbold">Approve:</span> Allows users to edit decision content and approve a decision or return it for edits. Oncea decision document is approved, it can be published.Approvers arenotincident owners unless assigned the role is assigned manually.Personnel with this privilege should be Agency Administrators. At least one approver must be assigned to the decision. Though it's not recommended as a general practice, approvers can approve the decision even if the reviewers have not yet reviewed it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">When you grant incident privileges to a group, each member of the group will receive incident privileges. For example, you may want to give Edit privileges to a group comprised of coworkers that you created in your personal WFDSS address book. If you subsequently change the group, the members who belonged to the group when you first granted the privileges will retain those privileges. To remove privileges for an individual, you must go through the Incident Privileges menu option, query the user's name, and unselect the checkbox for each privilege you want to revoke.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">If you are working in Training and want to keep incident privileges to yourself, you can grant yourself incident editing and approving privileges and publish a decision without assistance from others. You cannot assign yourself Review privileges however; you can should assign those to another WFDSS user when you want to explore the Review privilege and the effect it has on decision publishing.</p>
    <p class="heading2">Ownership Privileges</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Incidents can be owned by one or more users assigned the role of Author, GA Editor or National Editor. Users with the owner role manage the development of a decision and can submit a decision for review and eventual publishing. They can also grant Incident Ownership to or share ownership with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Other users assigned the Author role, or</li>
      <li class="listbullet">A group of WFDSS users that contains at least on Author.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">In addition, a user assigned the role of Author, GA Editor or National Editor can accept ownership of an incident if it has no owner. When multiple owners own an incident, each owner can add, manage and/or edit personnel assigned to assist with documentation. Changes in incident ownership can occur before or after <a href="../Incident/Declaring an Incident Out.htm">declaring an incident out </a>for reporting and analysis privileges.</p>
    <p class="warning">
      <MadCap:snippetText src="../../01_Common Content/Notes, Cautions, Warnings/caution about too many people editing incidents.flsnp" /> Limit the number of people who have editing access to the incident. While each incident is different, at a certain point, it can become a situation of "too many cooks in the kitchen", and it's important to ensure that the people reviewing and approving the decisions have the correct level of authority. </p>
