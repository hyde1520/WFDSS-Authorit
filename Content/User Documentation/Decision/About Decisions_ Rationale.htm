    <p class="bodytext">Before the WFDSS Decision Document can be sent for Review/Approval, an <a href="../Reference/decision reference/Decision Content_ Rationale.htm">Incident Rationale must be developed</a>. Decision Rationale should be primarily drafted by the decision Approver, but may require the Author to provide direction, support, and/or resources. Rationale accomplishes three things, it: </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Documents why a specific course of action was chosen, </li>
      <li class="listbullet">Records the risk decision dialog that has occurred among agency administrators and incident managers, and</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Provides the opportunity to tell the "story" of the incident. </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">Rationale can only be entered using a <a href="../Reference/decision reference/About the WFDSS Decision Editors.htm">decision editor</a>, which you can access from the Decisions tab once a pending decision has been created. Supporting text, images, and other information can be added to help relate incident events, if necessary.</p>
