    <p class="bodytext">The Text Editor, available only in the Advanced Decision Editor, is a powerful decision editing tool that allows incident owners and editors to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Edit contentin the Decision Content Tree,</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Add text, tables or images to a decision,</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Modify formatting, styles and font to added text,</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Display content from the Decision andIncident Content Trees (facilitating easy review of content before adding and withouthaving to leave the page), and</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Insert pagebreaksto your .pdf content prints neatly.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">The Default Decision Editor is more simplified in its approach, allowing edits but no options for modifying format or style. Adding content to a pending decision to help tie the sections of your decision together. Additional content can help you strengthen your decision document, describe your incident in greater detail, and/or justify choices you made in selecting inputs. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">The text editor allows incident owners and editors to organize and format decision document so that anyone reviewing the content will be able to clearly understand its intent and content. When the published decision is downloaded, a reader unfamiliar with your incident should be able to understand why you chose a particular Course of Action (COA) and how it will achieve Incident Objectives.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">After each addition or edit, make sure you click <span class="buttons">Save</span>. You can add text and other types of content to pending decision content using the Insert WFDSS Content and the Cut, Copy and Paste tools on the Text Editor. A pop-up dialog displays 3 minutes prior to a session timing out. At that time, contents are auto-saved if any changes were made.</p>
