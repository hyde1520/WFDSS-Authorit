    <p class="bodytext">Incident Owners and Editors can include fire behavior analysis results in a decision document. This is useful when results from fire behavior analyses are used to inform or support decision-making, relative risk assessment, courses of action, and/or rationale. The analysis must be "Accepted" by the Fire Behavior Specialist who completed the analysis before you can include it in a decision. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">You can include a <a href="To include analysis results in a decision_.htm">graphic of the analysis results</a>, as well as other <a href="">user-entered analysis information and text outputs</a>, such as the following:</p>
