    <h1 class="heading1">Publishing a Decision (for Incident Owners)</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Incident Owners are responsible for compiling the decision document and tracking the review and approval progress of a decision. These responsibilities include obtaining all information from Reviewers and Approvers, and ensuring Reviewers and Approvers complete the decision process in a timely manner.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">For a decision to be published, the following rules apply:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Use of the Reviewers role is not necessary are not required to publish a decision. If a Reviewer is assigned to a decision, a decision can be approved without the Reviewers acceptance/successful review. Decision Reviewers examine the documentation related to an incident decision and mark the decision as reviewed or return it for edits. If they are returning a decision for edits, they need to explain why. Marking a decision as reviewed does not mean that the decision is approved. A decision can only be approved by the Decision Approver(s). </li>
      <li class="listbullet">One or more Approvers must approve a decision. Before a decision is published, all designated Approvers must approve the decision. Once all designated approvers have approved the decision, the <span class="buttons">Publish Decision</span> button becomes available. The<a href="">Approving and Publishing a Decision </a>help topic provides additional information about the publishing process for Approvers.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">If any Reviewer or Approver returns the decision for edits, the decision is not published and the Incident Owner must make the necessary changes before resubmitting it for review/approval. </li>
    </ul>
