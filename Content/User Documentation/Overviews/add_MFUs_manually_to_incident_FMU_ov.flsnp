    <p class="bodytext">Incident Owners may need to manually associate FMUs to an incident when a unit does not have spatial FMU data within WFDSS or when an owner wants to manually associate an FMU that is outside of a planning area. Manually associating FMUs to an incident is done from the FMU list located on the left-hand menu of the WFDSS Incident tab.</p>
