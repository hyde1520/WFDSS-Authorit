    <p class="bodytext">All WFDSS users can view national and geographic area summary reports for the current fire season, and past seasons back to 2007. The national report lists the number of incidents logged by each geographic area, identifies status, and whether or not any decisions are pending or published. The geographic area report identifies the number of fires in the area, as well as how many incidents with each status have decisions associated with them.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">These reports are especially helpful to GA Editors and National Editors because you can get an overview of the status of incidents in your area of responsibility and filter each report by Date Range and/or Incident Type.</p>
