    <p class="bodytext">As an incident changes, you might need to update the shapes associated with a particular incident objective or management requirement. Incident obj. shapes form a many-to-many relationship with the objectives and requirements. This means that an incident obj. shape can be attached to many incident objectives or incident requirements. An incident objective/incident requirement can be attached to many shapes.</p>
