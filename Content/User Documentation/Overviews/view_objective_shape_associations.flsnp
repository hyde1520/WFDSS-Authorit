    <p class="bodytext">Once shapes are associated with an incident objective or requirement, Incident Owners and Editors can view the associations. Reviewers and Approvers can view associations when reviewing a pending decision. Other WFDSS users can view associations only after a decision has been published that includes the incident objectives and requirements associated to the shape.</p>
