    <p class="bodytext">From the Data Management tab, a user assigned the Data Manager role can only edit Strategic Objectives and/or Management Requirement text that has never been activated, so verify that the text appears exactly the way you want it before <a href="../Data Management/Activating and Deactivating Strategic Objectives and Management Requirements.htm">activating</a> it. Once activated, an incorrect set of Strategic Objective or Management Requirement text must be deactivated and recreated to include corrections.</p>
