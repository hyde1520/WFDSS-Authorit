    <p class="bodytext">Dispatchers can delete incidents within their geographic area for up to 72 hours unless someone accepts incident ownership. National Editors can delete any incident until a decision has been published. No other roles have incident deletion privileges within WFDSS.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Remember, incidents are part of the official system of record for fire management, and should not be deleted without a good reason (e.g., duplicate entries for the same incident).</p>
