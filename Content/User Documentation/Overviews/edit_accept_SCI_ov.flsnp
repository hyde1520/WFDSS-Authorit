    <p class="bodytext">After you have created a stratified cost index (SCI) for an incident, you can edit the parameters, calculate the SCI, and accept the results.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Only the person who created the SCI calculation can edit or accept that calculation. However, anyone with editing privileges for an incident can run an SCI for that incident.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">In addition, Viewers can only see an SCI calculation after it is accepted.</p>
