    <p class="bodytext">WFDSS replaces the WFIP, WFSA, and LTIP processes for preparing decision documents related to wildland fire incidents, and serves as the system of record for incident decisions. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">For most incidents, detailed decision reports and plans will not be necessary. The dispatcher will log the incident in WFDSS, the pre-planned course of action will be carried out, and the incident will be closed.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">However, for incidents that require management beyond the pre-planned course of action, decision reporting is required.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">This section explains the business process and the reporting process for using WFDSS in preparing decision documents. </p>
