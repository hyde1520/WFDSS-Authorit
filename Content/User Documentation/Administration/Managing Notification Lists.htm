    <h1 class="heading1">Managing Notification Lists<MadCap:keyword term="Notification Lists" /></h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Administrators and Geographic Area Editors manage notification lists from the Administration tab. Geographic Editors have access only to the Geographic Area Summary and the Fire Behavior Requests. Administrators and GA Editors can review user accounts to determine those accounts that have not been accessed in a specified number of days. The user has the option of exporting the Notification Lists to an Excel spreadsheet.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">There are notification lists for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">FLAME Act Report </li>
      <li class="listbullet">User Accounts</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Other </li>
      <li class="listbullet">Weather Related</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Service Broker Failure</li>
      <li class="listbullet">User Feedback</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Decision/FLAME Act Failures</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Geographic Area Summary</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Oversight Summary</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Fire Behavior Requests</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">When you subscribe to these notifications, you have two choices; to subscribe by WFDSS User ID or by an email address.</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">If you choose User ID, then the notifications are sent via text to the cell phone (if you've generated an alternate email address) and the email address listed in your WFDSS Contact Information</li>
      <li class="listbullet">If you'd like to receive the notifications via an email address other than what is listed in your Contact Information, you may enter it here.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">The option you choose impacts the way you receive notifications about things you've subscribed to, such as fire behavior requests. If you subscribe with your User ID, the you receive personal email notifications about these types of requests. If you subscribe with an email address other than what's listed in your contact information, you will receive a group email notification addressed to all users signed up with that option. If the "right" people do not seem to be included in these group emails, there are other ways to subscribe. </p>
