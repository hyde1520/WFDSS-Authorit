        <span class="specialbold">Managing WFDSS Passwords – Keep your password current!</span> Your WFDSS user name and password allows you to access the WFDSS application. Privileged users (National Editors, Administrators, and the Help Desk) must change their passwords every 30 days. All other users must change their passwords every 60 days. WFDSS sends 10 day and 3 day warning email alerts to help users avoid account lockout. When you fail to change your password prior to expiration your account locks.  You must contact the Helpdesk to obtain a new password.</li>

        <span class="specialbold">WFDSS Known Issues.</span> In 2017 a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wDBsMNilFVrGcEqyxkMeJV5QID5iR0mDJvynGYs69Dc/edit#gid=0">WFDSS Known Issues</a> document was created to keep WFDSS users and NFDSC staff informed of current WFDSS bugs/issues. It will be used again in 2018. If you experience an issue with the application or its performance, refer to the document to determine if the issue has been reported previously. You may learn helpful workarounds or a timeline for repair.  If the issue is not in covered in the document then it is likely a new issue that needs to be reported via Feedback in the Training or Production application.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <p>
          <span class="specialbold">Incident Groups.</span>  From the Incident Groups List, you can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="listbullet2">Collectively View Incident Group information in Excel format for all incidents in a group by selecting View Incident, and then clicking the Excel icon above and to the left of the Incident Name column, or</li>
          <li class="listbullet2">Quickly view current decision status for each incident in an incident group by selecting View Incident and then locating the Decision Status column on the far right. Click the hyperlink for an incident to review its decision status. If a published decision exists, the date is the hyperlink. If the first decision is pending, the hyperlink displays as "Pending." The column is blank for incidents without decisions.</li>
          <li class="listbullet2">Refer to <a href="../../User Documentation/Groups/Editing a Group.htm">Editing an Incident Group</a> for further information.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <span class="specialbold">Relative Risk (RR) and Organization Assessment (OA) graphics included in Decision Content.</span> In the past, RR and OA notes were automatically included in decision content but accompanying graphics/charts were not. Both the notes AND the graphics/charts are now automatically included in decision content and there is no need to add this content manually.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <span class="specialbold">Incident Owner receives ‘Decision Reviewable’ email.</span> Previously, only Decision Approvers received an email alert that a decision had been ‘submitted for review/ approval’ and was now Reviewable, indicating accessibility to approvers. This email is now sent to incident owners as well, to improve monitoring</li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <span class="specialbold">Wildcard Search Feature to Improve Incident Search by Name</span>. A wildcard search feature improves the ability to search for an incident by name  when using the quick search feature above the incident list.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <span class="specialbold">Decision Reject button updated to read ‘Return for Edit".</span> Previously, decision Reviewers and Approvers ‘rejected’ a decision to return it to pending status. Now, the button reads ‘Return for Edits’ to clarify intent and facilitate updating.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <span class="specialbold">Determine who has Drawn/Uploaded Fire Perimeter</span>. The name of the user who drew or uploaded a fire perimeter is now accessible in the LayerSwitcher when viewing a map display. To determine who drew or uploaded a shape, click the black expansion arrow beside the shape and the name will display below the effective date/time stamp.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <span class="specialbold">Improvements to Fire Behavior Request Screen. </span>In the past, a ‘Rationale for Request’ was required when submitting a request for fire behavior analysis. In an effort to encourage critical thought related to the request, the prompt has been improved to read "What management questions are you trying to answer through fire behavior modeling?" the additional information gleaned improves analysts ability to provide the best and most informative products given concerns to date.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <span class="specialbold">Option to Add Note to Approver when Submitting a Decision for Review/Approval.</span> Incident Owners can add an optional note to the Decision Approver(s) when they submit a decision for review/approval. The note is included in the notification mail to the approver(s) and added to the Incident History list, but it is NOT added to the decision. 500 character limit.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <span class="specialbold">Improved Access/Download options for Periodic Assessments. </span>You can now download an Excel file of all Periodic Assessments related to a decision. From the Decision tab, select a decision and then click View Info. An Assessment History section has been added; click the Excel icon in the upper left to download.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <p>
          <span class="specialbold">Merged Fire Behavior Specialist and Super Analyst Roles.</span> The role of Fire Behavior Specialist has expanded to include the same capabilities as Super Analyst. As a result of these changes, all Fire Behavior Specialists have the same capabilities as Super Analysts, but their title remains Fire Behavior Specialists. All users with the Super Analyst role will now be called Fire Behavior Specialists, but their capabilities remain the same. Fire Behavior Specialists can now:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="listbullet2">Set conditioning days to zero. This makes initial fuel moistures the same for every cell on the landscape, regardless of slope, aspect, elevation, shading and previous weather conditions.  It should, generally, only be used for model testing or homogeneous, unshaded fuels on flat terrain.</li>
          <li class="listbullet2">View, copy, and edit any analysis in the system without being added to the incident privileges.</li>
          <li class="listbullet2">Download more options for completed runs (All Models: Analysis Input. FSPRO: Daily Acres, Average Time Grid, Arrival Day Distribution, Suppression Effect, Ensemble Perimeters.)</li>
          <li class="listbullet2">‘Terminate’ runs that have been queued or are currently processing. NOTE: The Terminate button does NOT work instantaneously; it should only be clicked ONCE and it may take minutes, or hours, for the run to actually stop because it has to complete current calculations. Clicking it more than once could cause additional issues.</li>
          <li class="listbullet2">See <a href="../WFDSS_About/Fire Behavior Specialist and Super Analyst.htm">Fire Behavior Specialist</a> for more information.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="listbullet">I<span class="specialbold">mprovements to Fire Behavior Request Screen. </span>The fire behavior request screen solicits more detailed information related to the need for analysis. Rather than Rational for Request, the prompt now reads "What management questions are you trying to answer through fire behavior modeling?" to help you, the analyst, determine the best products for delivery. If the primary concerns (fuels, weather, topography, values, and so forth) are not outlined, contact the incident owner for clarification of Line Officer concerns.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <span class="specialbold">Spot Ignition Delay added for Short Term Fire Behavior (STFB).</span> The Spot Ignition Delay (&lt; = 60 minutes) has been added to STFB as a new input field on the Short Term Information page. As with NTFB, the input is an estimate of the amount of time that passes between an ember landing and fire spread occurring. The default is zero minutes.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <span class="specialbold">View Analysis Notes from Analysis List.</span> A Fire Behavior Specialist can view notes for a modeled run from the Analysis List by selecting a run and then clicking View Notes. This useful feature can help you quickly compare and contrast notes/inputs for individual runs when calibrating for example, without having to open the analysis itself.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <span class="specialbold">Ability to ‘Delete All’ Analysis Notes.</span> When you copy an analysis, you may not want to retain all the notes associated with it. The Delete All button helps you start from scratch without having to painstakingly delete each individual analysis note.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <span class="specialbold">Import Analysis Notes. </span>A Fire Behavior Specialist can import notes from one analysis into another (within an incident), to create documentation efficiencies when calibrating and/or creating runs with similar inputs. When importing notes between different modeled runs, FSPro to NTFB for example, only notes on shared pages (Landscape and Landscape Editor) import.</li>
