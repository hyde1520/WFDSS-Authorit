      <span class="specialbold">Note</span>: It is important to remember that the more automated the model, the less ability you have to refine the inputs. Because WFDSS Automated BFB is highly automated (providing fuels, weather, and topography data, and requiring very few inputs from the user), <span class="emphasis">carefully critique the results</span> before using them for supporting wildland fire decision making.</p>
