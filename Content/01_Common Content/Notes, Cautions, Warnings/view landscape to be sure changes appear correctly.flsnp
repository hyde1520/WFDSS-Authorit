      <span class="specialbold">CAUTION: </span>After creating a Landscape File that contains landscape edits, view the landscape to ensure that the edits you made in the Landscape Editor appear as you expected. A <a href="../../User Documentation/Analysis/Generating a Landscape Critique.htm">landscape critique</a> will help with this task. Landscape editor rules are applied using Boolean logic and, if edits to your landscape do not appear as they should, read <a href="../../User Documentation/Analysis/Landscape Editor Tips.flsnp">Landscape Editor Tips</a> and make appropriate rule edits.</p>
