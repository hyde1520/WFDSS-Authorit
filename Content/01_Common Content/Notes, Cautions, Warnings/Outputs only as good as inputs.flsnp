      <span class="specialbold">Caution:</span> The quality of the output from the analysis is only as good as the data input into the model. Before using the output results to support wildland fire decision-making, be sure that you understand the inputs: fuels data being used, the appropriateness of the RAWS from which fuel moistures are calculated, and the validity of the weather forecast data.</p>
