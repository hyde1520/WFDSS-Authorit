    <h1 class="heading1">Wildland Fire Decision Support System</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Welcome to the Wildland Fire Decision Support System (WFDSS)! </p>
    <p class="bodytext">This system is intended to assist fire managers and analysts in determining the response for fire incidents. It is designed to replace the WFSA (Wildland Fire Situation Analysis) process with one that is more intuitive and easier to use. WFDSS also incorporates the Wildland Fire Implementation Plan (WFIP) and Long-Term Incident Planning (LTIP) processes.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">WFDSS was conceived as a way of integrating the various applications used to manage incidents into a single system, which streamlines the analysis and reporting processes.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">WFDSS provides the following advantages over previous systems:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Combines desktop applications for fire modeling into a web-based system for easier data acquisition.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Provides an easy way for fire managers and analysts to accurately document their decision-making process by allowing results of analyses to be attached to the decision point and included in the final incident report.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Provides one decision process and documentation system for all types of wildland fires.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Is a web-based application for easier sharing of analyses and reports across all levels of the federal wildland fire organization.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Introduces economic principles into the fire decision process. </li>
    </ul>
