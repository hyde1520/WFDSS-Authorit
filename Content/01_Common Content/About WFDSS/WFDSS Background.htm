    <p class="bodytext">Over the past 30 years, fires have dramatically increased in size and complexity, often stretching the capacity of the management systems in place. The Wildland Fire Decision Support System (WFDSS) project evolved from the need to streamline and improve these decision-making processes, as well as take advantage of improvements in technology, fire modeling, and geospatial analysis. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">The former system, Wildland Fire Situation Analysis (WFSA) has been around for 30 years with little change, has become cumbersome to use, and is not scalable or flexible enough for today’s fire management needs.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">In June 2005, the National Fire and Aviation Executive Board chartered WFDSS to replace WFSA in 2009 with a system that has the following capabilities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Develops a scalable decision support system for agency administrators </li>
      <li class="listbullet">Uses appropriate fire behavior modeling, economic principles, and information technology </li>
      <li class="listbullet">Supports effective wildland fire decisions consistent with Resource and Fire Management Plans </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">WFDSS will also replace the Wildland Fire Implementation Plan (WFIP) and Long-Term Incident Planning (LTIP) processes.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">WFDSS has the following advantages over the existing systems:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Enables spatial data layering </li>
      <li class="listbullet">Reduces text, increases use of map displays </li>
      <li class="listbullet">Reduces input requirements </li>
      <li class="listbullet">Begins process at time of discovery </li>
      <li class="listbullet">Removes alternative comparison and decision tree development </li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <p>Pre-loads information from the following sources to allow pre-planning: </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="listbullet2">Land Management Plans/Fire Management Plans </li>
          <li class="listbullet2">Other sources </li>
          <li class="listbullet2">Preplanned decision criteria </li>
          <li class="listbullet2">Local spatial data files </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="listbullet">Provides scalability for incident complexity</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Can be ended at any level, can progress through levels, or jump to appropriate level </li>
      <li class="listbullet">Can be used for single or multiple fire situations.</li>
    </ul>
