    <h1 class="heading1">Fire Behavior Modeling Considerations with LANDFIRE 2010 v1.2.0</h1>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Users will notice an increase in the amount of rock represented as a fuel model 99, especially in higher elevation areas.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Users will still need to update fire scars and other disturbance after 2010.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Either the Finney (1998) or Scott and Reinhardt (2001) (https://www.fire.org/downloads/nexus/2.0.0/rp29.pdf) crown fire method (CFM) is suitable for the initial analysis. </li>
      <li class="listbullet">The Scott and Reinhardt CFM will produce greater rate of spread and flame lengths when fire type is predicted as passive crown fire compared to Finney CFM. </li>
      <li class="listbullet">Users are encouraged to download the LCP critique in WFDSS to evaluate the fire behavior fuel models and canopy attributes that will affect predicted fire behavior.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">
      <span class="specialbold">Note</span>: Because these data can be downloaded and used in multiple places or use different fire modeling tools within WFDSS, there are other ramifications for using all the various datasets in FSPro, short-term fire behavior, near-term fire behavior, etc. Consequently, you should <span class="specialbold">calibrate </span>the final selected crown fire method to observed fire behavior and adjust it to the local area.</p>
