    <p class="bodytext">When developing an appropriate planning area for an incident, it is important to include input from various fire managers, agency administrators, and potential resource specialists or other staff. Proper sizing of a planning area is important to identify the area of potential incident impact. Local Fire Managers (i.e. Incident I.C., Incident Operations, and Duty Officer) can help identify the area of expected actions, Management Action Point (M.A.P.s), and containment boundaries. In the absence of local guidance, fire behavior modeling outputs can also help inform the creation of a realistic planning area.</p>
