    <p class="bodytext">Incident Editors and Owners can create a draft .PDF copy of a decision or section of a decision, and individual reports. Once created, draft documents can be downloaded, saved and/or printed. The PDF can later be shared in hard copy or soft copy form as needed.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">The WFDSS application maintains a single .PDF draft copy of a decision or section of a decision, or a report before it is published. If a draft .PDF is already available when you click Create Draft, the application deletes the already existing draft .PDF. Also, when a draft .pdf exists when you click Publish Decision or Publish Report, the application deletes the existing draft .PDF. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">An entry is posted to the Decision History file every time the application generates a new decision or report .PDF draft. The Decision History can be accessed by clicking View Info on the Decisions page.</p>
