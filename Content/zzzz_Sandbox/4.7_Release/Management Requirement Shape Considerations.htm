    <h1 class="heading1">Management Requirement Shape Considerations</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Data Managers need to be aware of these considerations while working with Management Requirement shapes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">A Management Requirement shape is not visible to users unless it is associated with an activated Management Requirement.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">WFDSS users can only view activated Management Requirements in the <a href="../../Glossary Terms/LayerSwitcher.htm">LayerSwitcher</a> and on map displays.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Data Managers cannot edit an activated Management Requirement for use with a Management Requirement shape. If the requirement needs editing, you must deactivate the requirement and create a new requirement.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Replacing a Management Requirement shape automatically deactivates any associated Management Requirements but immediately copies and activates these requirements with the new shape.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">You cannot delete Management Requirement shape associated with an activated Management Requirement.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Only National Editors and Data Managers can view non-activated Management Requirements.</li>
    </ul>
