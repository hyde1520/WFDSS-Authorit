    <p class="bodytext">Spatial Fire Planning (SFP) is an optional planning process available in WFDSS that can spatially describe an administrative unit's Strategic Objectives and Management Requirements. WFDSS users assigned the role of Data Manager manage SFP and associated tasks. Using this type of planning in WFDSS, administrative units can visually display language from their Land, Resource, and Fire Management Plans on a map display as shapes. The visual depiction of these data allow for greater data control because Data Managers can upload, manage, and associate shapes to represent their unit's planning direction, and make changes as needed throughout the year.</p>
    <p class="note">
      <span class="specialbold">Note</span>: SPATIAL FIRE PLANNING IS OPTIONAL. SFP is a tool to spatially depict National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) approved guidance from an administrative unit's Land, Resource, and/or Fire Management Plans. Once the decision is made by an administrative unit to switch to SFP, Data Managers choose the SFP option from the Data Management tab. Selecting SFP requires a thorough understanding of the process and tasks required to successfully implement it. See <a href="Spatial Fire Planning (SFP) Considerations.htm">Spatial Fire Planning Considerations</a> for more information.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">SFP is implemented using <a href="Strategic Objective Shapes.htm">Strategic Objective shapes</a> and <a href="Management Requirement Shapes.htm">Management Requirement shapes</a> that best represent an administrative unit's planning direction. Strategic Objective shapes are managed nationally. Management Requirement shapes are uploaded by a WFDSS Data Manager at the administrative unit level, and are managed at the local unit level.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Administrative units moving to the SFP process can keep their current FMU shape layer when the FMU shapes and codes are representative of the Strategic Objective shapes and codes the administrative unit wants to use for SFP. When FMU shapes or codes require edits before they can be used to represent Strategic Objectives, or a new Strategic Objective shape layer is warranted, Data Managers must develop and submit their new Strategic Objective shapefile (using the same <a href="http://wfdss.usgs.gov/wfdss/pdfs/Geospatial_data_stnd.pdf">geospatial data standards</a> that were applicable to the FMU shapefile) to the <a href="../../Home Page (Website)/WFDSS_Data/WFDSS GIS Team.htm">WFDSS Data Team Contact</a>. This individual reviews and submits the data to WFDSS for uploading. When a new shape layer is submitted for upload, it could take a couple of months for the new shape layer to be enabled in WFDSS, as new FMU or Strategic Objective shapefiles are uploaded to the National layer on a <a href="https://wfmrda.nwcg.gov/SpatialData/Docs/FMU_Update_Sched.html">quarterly schedule</a>.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">The administrative Unit Outline that displays in the Unit Fire Planning map layers is determined by the Strategic Objective shape(s) that are uploaded. When administrative units draw or upload a Management Requirement shape that does not fit the administrative unit boundary, WFDSS clips the shape to the unit boundary.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Spatial Fire Planning can be implemented in both WFDSS Training and Production using the same steps. Since the databases used by each application are independent of one another, choosing the SFP process in one application does not automatically choose it in the other. This makes WFDSS Training the ideal place for testing the Spatial Fire Planning process for an administrative unit. Depending on the agency affiliation of an administrative unit, choosing SFP over the more traditional FMU fire planning is the decision to manage the unit’s Fire Management Plan (FMP) spatially. As a result, a Fire Management Plan becomes a spatial Fire Management Plan and less of a textual document. </p>
    <p class="warning">
      <span class="specialbold">WARNING</span>: You should test the SFP process in WFDSS Training before you use it in WFDSS Production. You can choose to switch back to the FMU planning process at any time. This provides you with a safe way to understand how this planning process works in your unit.</p>

    <p class="note">
      <MadCap:snippetText src="../Diane/SFP/Determining if an Administrative Unit is ready to switch to Spatial Fire Planning (SFP).flsnp" />WARNING: When you select the SFP process option, FMU-level Management Requirements are immediately disabled and can <span class="editorialcomments">NOT</span> be re-enabled. IF you save this data to an Excel spreadsheet before switching to SFP, you can recreate this data in WFDSS if you choose to return to the FMU planning process at a later date. To export the FMU Planning entries, click the Excel icon at the top of the list on the Objectives page before choosing the SFP option. However, you can save this data in Excel before moving to SFP and recreate this data in WFDSS if you choose to return to the FMU planning process from the SFP process at a later date.</p>
