    <p class="bodytext">Strategic Objectives are broad statements from land and resource management and fire management plans that identify changes in water, soil, air, or vegetation from the present to proposed conditions, but can also describe an existing resource condition that should be maintained. These objectives deal with large areas (the spatial component) over long time periods and project intended outcomes of management activities that contribute to the maintenance or achievement of desired conditions. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">Spatial Fire Planning (SFP) requires both the textual and spatial components of Strategic Objectives. Users assigned the role of Data Manager are responsible for locating this information in NEPA-approved planning documents and entering it correctly into WFDSS. The textual and spatial content loaded into WFDSS must accurately represent planning direction for an administrative unit and is used to support incident decision-making.</p>

    <p class="bodytext">The intent of the Strategic Objective shape layer is to allow users to utilize shapes other than FMUs to visually depict an administrative unit’s fire management direction. Although these shapes are called "Strategic Objectives", they can represent one or many of the following terms:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Administrative Unit boundary </li>
      <li class="listbullet">FMUs </li>
      <li class="listbullet">Fire Workload Areas</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Management Areas  </li>
      <li class="listbullet">Management Prescription Categories </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">Data Managers manage Strategic Objective shapes just like they have managed FMU shapes in the past. Data Managers submit their administrative unit’s spatial data to their <a href="">WFDSS Data Team Contact</a>. The WFDSS Data Team Contact ensures the spatial data is enabled in WFDSS. The Strategic Objective shapes are then used to build a unit outline shape for each administrative unit.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Each Strategic Objective shape is associated with one or more sets of Strategic Objective text that are entered on the Data Management tab. The WFDSS application supplies a list of common objectives that help Data Managers quickly associate objectives to the shape, or they can create new objectives and associate them with the shape. If Strategic Objective shapes overlap, Data Managers received a message asking how to clip the shape; overlapping strategic objectives is not permitted.</p>
