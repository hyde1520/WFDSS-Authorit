    <p class="bodytext">Data Managers should <a href="../Diane/SFP/What happens when I select the Spatial Fire Planning Proces on the Data Management tab_.htm">understand what happens when they select the SFP process</a> on the Data Management tab, and then carefully consider these points before moving from FMU Planning to Spatial Fire Planning (SFP):</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">WFDSS allows for the use of FMU Planning or Spatial Fire Planning (SFP), not both.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Prior to selecting the radio button for SFP, Data Managers should export the FMU Planning entries to Excel and save them to a safe storage area. You use these entries to recreate the FMU planning entries if for some reason you opt to revert back to the FMU planning process. To export the FMU Planning entries, click on the Excel icon at the top of the list on the Objectives page before selecting Spatial Fire Planning.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">If a new or updated spatial layer needs to be submitted to WFDSS for use with SFP, the overall transition process from FMU planning to spatial fire planning could take a few months as new spatial data is enabled in the National data layer on a quarterly schedule. As a result, switching to a different planning process should be done during the off-season to minimize potential incident documentation conflicts for fire managers.</li>
