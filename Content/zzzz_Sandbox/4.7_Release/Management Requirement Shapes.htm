    <p class="bodytext">Management Requirements are derived from Land, Resource and/or Fire Management Plan standards and guidelines information. Management Requirements represent the recommended technical and scientific specifications for management activities and/or potential actions to help achieve objectives across broad areas in general terms. They provide the foundation, framework, and limitations/challenges for potential management activities. Management Requirements are not commitments or final implementation decisions.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Spatial Fire Planning (SFP) requires both the textual and spatial components of Management Requirements. FMU planning, in contrast, only requires Management Requirement text. Users assigned the role of Data Manager are responsible for locating standards and guidelines in planning documents and ensuring that the text and associated shapes are entered correctly into WFDSS. The textual and/or spatial content loaded into WFDSS to represent Management Requirements must accurately represent planning direction for an administrative unit and are used to support incident decision-making. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">Management Requirement shapes can overlap Strategic Objective shapes and/ or overlap other Management Requirement Shapes as shown in this simplified example. </p>

    <p class="bodytext">Management Requirement shapes are managed differently than Strategic Objectives shapes. Whereas Strategic Objective shapes are submitted to an agency's WFDSS data team contact for uploading, administrative units can manage Management Requirement shapes at the unit level. Data Managers can upload or draw shapes directly in WFDSS. Each Management Requirement shape has associated text that describes a specific standard or guideline applicable to that area.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">The process to add Management Requirements shapes and direction is similar to the current process used to create Other Unit Shapes. Because administrative units can manage their own Management Requirement shapes, these shapes can be used to represent temporal or condition based requirements. This allows a unit’s direction to change throughout fire season as species of concern migrate, or drought conditions worsen or improve to name a few examples.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">These shapes can be used to, but are not limited to the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Consideration &amp; Constraints</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Required actions in specific areas</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Equipment and retardant restrictions in specific areas</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Planned &amp; implemented fuel treatments and details</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Desired future condition objective that affects a small area of the unit without conflicting with other strategic objectives they may overlap</li>
    </ul>
