    <p class="bodytext">MTBS data are delivered to WFDSS as a “Web Mapping Service” directly from the MTBS program, and as such, new data will be available in WFDSS as it is updated by MTBS. MTBS updates the web service as fires are processed, and data (including the addition of prior year data in response to user requests) are added to the service throughout the year. Announcements of new data are provided on the <a href="https://mtbs.gov/announcements">MTBS Announcements</a> webpage.</p>
