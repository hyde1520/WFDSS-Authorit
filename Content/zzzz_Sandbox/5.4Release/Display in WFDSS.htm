    <p class="bodytext">MTBS data for the continental United States (CONUS) are separated into layers by year, with a toggle “check box” that can turn on any single year’s data. For a single year, burn area boundaries as mapped by MTBS are displayed as a red outline. Burn severities within each burn area boundary are shown as a categorized image (thematic raster) color-coded according to burn severity:</p>

    </p>
    <p class="bodytext">Color-coded burn severities, with dark green representing the “Unburned to Low” severity category, cyan as “Low” severity, yellow as “Moderate” severity, red as “High” severity, light green as “Increased Greeness”, and white as non-processed areas.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Due to the nature of the data as imagery rather than polygon features, it is not possible to select and copy a specific category to create a mask. Instead, the data can be used as a background upon which a mask can be drawn. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">Data for each calendar year are displayed as layer in the WFDSS layer-switcher tree. Each year can be turned on or off individually by clicking its corresponding check-box. The last five years of data are displayed at the top of the tree, and the older data (dating back to 1984) are displayed under the heading “Older”.</p>
