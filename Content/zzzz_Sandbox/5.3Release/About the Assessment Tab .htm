    <h1 class="heading1">About the Assessment Tab </h1>
    <p class="bodytext">The Assessment tab allows consolidated access to the Relative Risk and Organization Assessments, both required parts of a decision. The customized Risk Tables and Benefits assessments provide an additional level of decision support, as do the Weather, Risk, and Benefits sections of a decision which are accessible when editing decision content. Fire behavior analysis results, such as STFB, NTFB, and FSPro are also a necessary assessment element and if available, can be added to a decision using the decision editors. Collectively, these assessments frame the risk associated with an incident and help guide development of Incident Objectives, Incident Requirements and an appropriate Course of Action.</p>
    <p class="note">Note: If using the Default Decision Editor, fire behavior results can be added to a decision on the Risk vertical tab. If the Advanced Decision Editor is used, fire behavior analysis results must be added via the Text Editor (accessible when editing a decision).</p>
