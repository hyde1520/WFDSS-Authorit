    <h1 class="heading1">System Generated Basic Fire Behavior Runs</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">System Generated Basic Fire Behavior runs are generated automatically by WFDSS. The intent of the runs are to produce spatial Hauling Charts for incidents of interest, which are currently defined as active incidents (not contained, controlled, or out), with a discovery date within the last 7 days, AND for which there is accepted ownership.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">The Hauling Charts include the date, time, wind speed, and direction (1500 forecast winds) for the selected RAWS, and the resolution for the landscape used to generate the Basic outputs. Processing the runs is completed overnight; runs are updated each day for 7 days during the early morning hours.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Potential uses:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Provide a quick snapshot of modeled fire behavior for optional use in making risk-based decisions on new starts and/or prioritizing fires in multiple start scenarios.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Highlight the utility of the Hauling Charts as a risk assessment tool.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Highlight the utility of the Basic Fire Behavior model.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Provide fire behavior specialists with a first look at auto-generated outputs to use as a starting point for further analysis.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Provide managers with a tool that can be used to assess potential fire effects benefits.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">To test functionality of auto-generated fire behavior runs for expanded/future use.</li>
    </ul>
