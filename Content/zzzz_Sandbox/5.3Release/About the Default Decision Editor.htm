    <h1 class="heading1">About the Default Decision Editor</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">The Default Decision Editor provides an intuitive, quick, and easy way to put together a decision for an incident and automatically opens when a pending decision is edited. Vertical Tabs represent each section of the decision; providing quick movement between sections. Hyperlinks in decision sections link to other components to speed completion of required sections. This feature, combined with the Situation Map opening in a separate window, allows users to quickly complete required sections while viewing map components/features. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">You can create the majority of decision inputs within the Default Decision Editor itself, eliminating the need to navigate between tabs and menu options. Adding additional content is also easy, as check boxes allow a quick way to add optional content to each decision section. You can also add simple text and uploaded/captured images. If you need to add tables or assign formats and/or styles to text, the Advanced Decision Editor may be a better option for your decision editing as it contains a more robust set of editing tools.</p>
    <p class="note">
      <span class="specialbold">Note</span>: When inserting sections of text, character count limits do apply. If character counts are exceeded, users will receive a popup alert, the cursor will stop, and pasted text within each field will be truncated at the limit. Unlimited sections can be added, however, if more text is needed.</p>
