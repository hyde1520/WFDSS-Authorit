    <h1 class="heading1">Creating and Editing Customized Risk Tables </h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Users can create and edit customized risk tables on the <span class="menuoptions">Assessment </span>tab, or on the Risk vertical tab if editing a decision using the Default Decision Editor. This feature was added to WFDSS to enable creation of tables when working with the Default Decision Editor, and to allow easy incorporation of the various styles of risk tables used among the geographic areas in support of incident decision-making.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Values tables generated from drawing planning areas or completed FSPro, NTFB, or STFB runs can be saved as custom tables, and then modified to display values information in a way that is meaningful and specific to an incident. You can add rows and/or columns to these tables, as well as modify existing fields, enabling you to align information from both inside and outside of WFDSS to help fire managers and line officers accurate assess and evaluate those influences on the fire that affect risk based decision making. You cannot create a custom risk table without a planning area or a completed analysis.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">For example, a planning area inventory may only display a portion of threatened values for an incident. Creating a custom table would enable you to document additional values for the incident and add acreages and other types of supporting information. Publishing the table will then make it available for you to add to decision content (failing to publish leaves it in draft form). You can add the table to a decision by choosing it from the Risk Tables drop-down list located on the Risk vertical tab in the default decision editor, or by adding it to the decision content from the incident content when working with the advanced decision editor.</p>
