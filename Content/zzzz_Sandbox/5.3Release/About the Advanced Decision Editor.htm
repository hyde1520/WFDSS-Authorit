    <h1 class="heading1">About the Advanced Decision Editor</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">If you choose to use the Advanced Decision Editor for decision editing, primary decision inputs must be developed within the incident perspective, using tabs (Assessment, Objectives, etc.) atop the page or menu options on the left. Additional content is added using the <a href="../../User Documentation/Decision/About the Text Editor.htm">Text Editor</a>, and by moving content from the <a href="../../User Documentation/About_Topics/About the Incident Content Tree.htm">Incident Content Tree</a> to the <a href="../../User Documentation/About_Topics/About the Decision Content Tree.htm">Decision Content Tree</a>. You can type text freely, to describe inputs in more depth, or describe the reasons why you developed a particular input (or chose not to for that matter). You can also add images or other items saved or uploaded to Incident Content. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">Although the Advanced Decision Editor contains the same decision sections as the Default Decision Editor, it provides advanced editing features not available in the <a href="About the Default Decision Editor.htm">Default Decision Editor</a>, including the ability to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Add Tables</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Adjustfont color/size</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Highlight text</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Add superscript/subscript text</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Addbullets</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">To edit a decision with the Advanced Decision Editor, select <span class="buttons">Convert to Advanced</span> on the Decision tab when all sections of a Pending Decision are Checked In.</p>
