    <p class="bodytext">Incident Owners and Editors create and save previous versions of a decision's content in the decision content database. The WFDSS application creates one or more versions of decision content (by date and time) in the decision content database in order for you retrieve corrupted data and/or rollback and use an earlier content version. You should save decision content often to take advantage of this versioning functionality. Once you publish a decision, all content from previous versions of the decision are deleted from the decision content database; you cannot retrieve this information.</p>
