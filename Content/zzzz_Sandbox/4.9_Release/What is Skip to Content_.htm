    <h1 class="heading1">What is Skip to Content?</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">The Skip to Content feature was created to meet federal requirements for 508 compliance and accessibility. Screen readers are a form of assistive technology that provide audible explanation of fields/items visible on a screen. Users of these technologies use the tab function to move from section to section on a screen; using the Skip to Content option allows the screen reader to skip right to the primary fields of interest on that page. This option is coded specifically for screen readers to quickly recognize, enabling the quick recognition.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">For instance, consider a user employing this type of technology while viewing the Objectives page in WFDSS. If the user tabs through the various fields and options on the page, many of the items would not be of interest to the user (such as the WFDSS logo or unrelated menu options). Clicking on Skip to Content returns the browser's focus to the first section listed on the Objectives page, which happens to be the Active Status Filter.</p>
