    <h1 class="heading1">About IRWIN Data Exchange</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">WFDSS uses a data exchange service called IRWIN (Integrated Reporting of Wildland Fire Information) to exchange information with other wildland fire applications such as computer aided dispatch systems (CADs) and ICS 209 (Incident Status Summary). IRWIN acts as a central hub that orchestrates data transfer between these applications. This reduces duplicate data entry and ensures the most current data is available in all of the participating applications. IRWIN also detects conflicts and supports resolution on all new wildfire incidents to support a unique record for each ignition.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">In order to resolve inconsistencies between applications, the applications are ranked based on a level of authority. The data flow between applications is based on rules, where the information from an application is given a ranking based on its level of authority. IRWIN maintains a record of the “authority” of the data coming from each application. Authority can be thought of as an order of precedence. A system can only update an element in IRWIN if their permission hierarchy value is higher (they are of higher rank) than the last system that either created or updated that element. If another application has higher rank for a specific data element, the data field in the incident information field will be grayed out, and cannot be edited. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">Additional IRWIN-related information is available from the <a href="https://www.wildfirelessons.net/communities/community-home?CommunityKey=1b5be2e6-30ab-47ab-bae2-599b07b940eb">Wildland Fire Lessons Learned Center</a>. You can create an account or contact an IRWIN team member if needed.</p>

    <p class="heading2">Order of Fire Record Creation in Dispatch Centers</p>
    <p class="heading3">When WildCAD is in use in a dispatch center: </p>
    <p class="bodytext">When a Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) is in use in a dispatch center, all fires should be entered in the CAD first. Fire Codes can be requested through the CADs, and most data elements will be updated in CAD. WFDSS will inform users when data elements must be updated in the CAD application. </p>
    <p class="heading3">When a CAD is not in use in a dispatch center: </p>
    <p class="bodytext">To avoid duplicates, all fires that will need a Fire Code should be entered into the FireCode application before being used in WFDSS or SIT-209. If the fire is created in WFDSS or SIT-209 first, FireCode will create a duplicate record that will be passed to the other applications. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">Once the FireCode record has been created, search in WFDSS or SIT-209 for the incident by name or unique fire ID (example 2014-AZGCP-000001).</p>
    <p class="bodytext">If you cannot find the record in WFDSS or SIT-209, proceed to create the incident in one of those applications. Pay very close attention to the warning messages you get that indicate the existence of a similar incident. Perhaps the fire number is different, or the name seems wrong- but if the timing and the Lat/Long of the incident are the same, it is best to investigate to see if someone has simply made a data entry error- your fire may already exist in WFDSS. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">If you find that you have accidentally created a duplicate, contact the help desk of the affected application. In WFDSS, this is most easily accomplished by clicking the “feedback” link in the upper right-hand side of the application. Using “feedback” is best because the information you send includes a direct link to your incident and there is no question about which needs to be deleted. </p>
    <p class="heading2">False Alarms and Non-Fire Records </p>
    <p class="bodytext">Occasionally records for non-fire are created in other applications and inadvertently passed to WFDSS through IRWIN. Examples include False Alarms, training incidents, and requests for Severity or “Step-Up” FireCodes. </p>
    <p class="heading3">Actions </p>
    <p class="bodytext">Any dispatcher, author, or GA Editor user who notices records in WFDSS that are non-fire are encouraged to change the incident type to other “Other” on the Information page. Within IRWIN, this will mark the incident as type: “False Alarm” and will change the record from active to inactive, signaling to all other applications that the record is not a valid wildfire. On the WFDSS maps, an incident of type “other” will be displayed as an oval rather than the “kite” shape used by Wildfire incidents. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">If desired, a dispatcher, author, or GA Editor may also set an “Out” date/time for the record so that it does not display on maps or in common incident filters. </p>

    <p class="heading2">Frequently Asked Questions  </p>
    <p class="heading4">Q. How can I tell if an incident in WFDSS was created by a WFDSS user, or passed from another application via IRWIN? </p>
    <p class="bodytext">A. To see if IRWIN has created or updated the WFDSS incident record, choose “Incident History List” from the left side menu in WFDSS when on the Incident Information tab. If the incident originated in IRWIN, the username for the incident creation step will be “IRWIN”. </p>
    <p class="heading4">Q. How can I tell if an incident in WFDSS has been modified by another application via IRWIN? </p>
    <p class="bodytext">A. If the record was created by a WFDSS user, the user’s name and user role will be displayed in the “Incident History List”, linked on the left-hand side of the incident information screen. If another application updated the record through IRWIN, you will see “IRWIN” displayed as the user in a later step. If the modifying application is considered to be more authoritative than WFDSS for basic incident information, the incident information elements that have been modified by IRWIN will be greyed out on the incident information screen. A green message will appear at the top of the incident information screen instructing the user to contact the appropriate more authoritative application to make any changes to the incident information that may be required. </p>
