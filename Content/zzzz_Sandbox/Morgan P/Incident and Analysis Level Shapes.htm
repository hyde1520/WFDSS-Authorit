          <span class="specialbold">Planning Areas.</span>Planning areas are polygons that can be drawn by Incident Owners,Editors, and Geographic Area Editors (within the geographic area)from the Situation Map. You cannot uploaded them using the Shape Upload option. </li>
        <li class="listbullet2">
          <span class="specialbold">Fire Perimeters.</span> Fire perimeters are polygons that display past and current fire perimeters. Incident Owners,Editors, Dispatchers, Geographic Area Editors (within the geographic area), Fire Behavior Specialists and those with Analysis Edit Privilegescan draw fire perimeters on the Situation mapand Analysis Mapor use the Shape Upload option from the left hand menu.A fire perimeter's Acreage, Effective Date, and Uploaded By information is viewed by clicking the drop-down list beside the name in the LayerSwitcher.</li>

            <span class="specialbold">Management Action Points</span>
          </a>
          <span class="specialbold"> (M.A.P.).</span>M.A.P.s are points, lines, or polygons that Incident Owners,Editors, and Geographic Area Editors (within the geographic area)can draw or upload to spatially represent Management Action Points. These shapes can be uploaded following <a href="">Uploading Shapes for Management Action Points</a> or drawn on the Situation Map. </li>
        <li class="listbullet2">
          <span class="specialbold">Incident Obj. Shapes.</span> Incident obj. shapes are points, lines, or polygons that spatially tie an incident objective or requirement to a location on the landscape. Incident Owners,Editors, and Geographic Area Editors (within the geographic area)can draw Objectives shapes on the Situation Map and associate them to specific incident objectives and/or requirements. This is a many-to-many relationship; a single shape can be associated to multiple objectives and requirements, and a single objective or requirement can be associated with many shapes.These shapes can also be uploaded using the Shape Upload option.</li>
        <li class="listbullet2">
          <span class="specialbold">Points of Interest.</span> Points of Interest are points that can be drawn on the Situation map by incident Owners,Editors, Dispatchers, Geographic Area Editors (within the geographic area), Fire Behavior Specialists and those with Analysis Edit Privileges. They cannot be uploaded using the Upload Shape Option. These shapes are useful to display and spatially represent points of interest on the Situation map. </li>
        <li class="listbullet2">
          <span class="specialbold">Analysis Ignitions.</span> Analysis Ignitions are points, lines, or polygons that can be used for fire behavior analysis by Fire Behavior Specialists.Incident Owners, Editors, those with Analysis Edit privileges, and Dispatchers &amp; Geographic Area Editors (within the geographic area)can use the Shape Upload option to upload Analysis Ignitions or draw and manipulate them from the Situation or Analysis Maps. </li>
        <li class="listbullet2">
          <span class="specialbold">Landscape Masks.</span> Landscape Masks arepolygons that analysts use to change fuel characteristics in a defined area on a modeled landscape. Analysts use masks to make modeled fire more representative of observed fire behavior, or to incorporate changes that are not represented in the existing fuel layer (fire activity, beetle kill, blow-down, etc.). Incident Owners, Editors, Fire Behavior Specialists, those with Analysis Edit Privileges, and Dispatchers &amp; Geographic Area Editors (within the geographic area)candraw landscape masks on the Situation or Analysis Map. You can also upload them using the Shape Upload option.</li>
        <li class="listbullet2">
          <span class="specialbold">Barriers.</span> Barrier shapes arelines or polygons that analysts use to make areas of a modeled landscape un-burnable when using fire modeling tools. Incident Owners, Editors, Fire Behavior Specialists, those with Analysis Edit Privileges, and Dispatchers &amp; Geographic Area Editors (within the geographic area)candraw barrier shapes on the Situation or Analysis Map. They can also upload them from the Shape Upload option.</li>
