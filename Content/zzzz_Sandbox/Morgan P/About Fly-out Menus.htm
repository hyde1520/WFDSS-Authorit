    <h1 class="heading1">About Fly-out Menus</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">As a default, some of the menus in the WFDSS application are "fly-out menus", such as the left hand menu available on incident level tabs and the right hand Requirements menu on the Decisions tab.  Fly-out menus increase screen space because they do not display until you are ready to use them. You hover your mouse over the edge of the menu until it  "flies out" onto the screen. Fly-out menus move off screen once the mouse is moved away from the menu.  Although they provide more screen space, Fly-out menus do not meet 508 accessibility requirements. Additionally, some users may experience challenges with this menu style when using older versions of some browsers or when accessing WFDSS on a mobile device.  </p>
    <p class="bodytext">The Incident Content Library fly-out menu option allows you to review all information related to an incident. This option allows users to view the most current incident information summarized in a clear format, without having to access it using a decision editor.</p>
