    <p class="bodytext">Although Incident Authors, Owners and Editors can enter Incident Objectives and Incident Requirements in WFDSS, it is ultimately the Agency Administrator's responsibility to ensure the WFDSS Decision follows policy and guidance and reflects their intent.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">When developing Incident Objectives and Incident Requirements include input from various resource specialists or other staff. Informed input allows for the creation of better objectives, and can give resource specialists and managers the opportunity to express their concerns and associated mitigations that may be necessary. In the absence of an interdisciplinary team of resource specialists, the Author can utilize the Values Inventory from the creation of the Planning Area to inform Incident Objectives and Incident Requirements. For more information about Incident Objectives and Incident Requirements visit the <a href="https://wfmrda.nwcg.gov/decision_support.php">Wildland Fire Management RD&amp;A</a> Website.</p>
