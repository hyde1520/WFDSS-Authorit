    <p class="bodytext">One of the significant limitations identified with census-based approaches to mapping human population occurs where non-developed land, including public lands, are included within a census block. This can result in large, sparsely settled areas showing relatively low population density across a large polygon- when in reality a small cluster of homes (small dense population) is surrounded by totally uninhabited lands. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">To work around this limitation, LandScan uses “Intelligent” dasymetric modeling to refine the distribution of the population within each census block polygon (Bhaduri et al., 2007). Rather than evenly distributing the population throughout the census block,the LandScan algorithm divides each polygon into a 90-meter grid and distributes the total block population to the grid cells according to weights proportional to the calculated likelihood of being populated. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">The likelihood of being populated is based on proximity to landmarks and geographic features such as roads and water bodies, as well as geologic features such as slope. Where available, structure location data was also incorporated into this methodology. These statistical models are further improved through analyst intervention to validate input data and parameters. The sum of the population of all cells within a census block is constrained to equal that of the census block in order to maintain the integrity of the census data.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">While population is represented at the relatively high resolution of 90 meters/pixel, precision of the data does not support analysis at large scales, due to displacement between a given pixel and the structure/structures it represents. Thus, the data are appropriate for use at a strategic level, but not at a tactical level. To encourage use at the appropriate scale, these data are not displayed at scales zoomed in beyond 1:50,000.</p>
