    <p class="bodytext">LANDFIRE 2012 v1.3.0 data for the continental United States, Alaska and Hawaii were delivered in 2013. LANDFIRE 2010 1.2.0 refines urban, agriculture, and wetlands as well as incorporates disturbance (fire, vegetation management, weather, insects and disease) and succession through 2010.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">This data is used by WFDSS for fire behavior analysis, and when users query fuels and topographic data on incident and intelligence map displays. Users can change the default selection on the Incident Information page, if they choose. If an analyst chooses a different data source for an analysis, the chosen data source would override the incident default data source for that analysis only.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">LANDFIRE 2012 v1.3.0 adds more agricultural land updates from LANDFIRE Refresh 2010 v1.2.0. . The update includes: </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">LANDFIRE (LF) 2012 was an update to LF2010 to more accurately represent current conditions and account for landscape disturbances that occurred in CY 2011 and 2012. Disturbances include: treatment activities such as wildland fire, fuel and vegetation treatments, mortality from insects and disease, storm damage, invasive plants, and other natural or anthropogenic events. </li>
      <li class="listbullet">LF 2012 used National Agricultural Statistics Service's Cropland Data Layer 2012 (CDL) for agricultural refinements. </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">Several enhancements were made to the existing vegetation type layer in LF 2012: </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">responses to vegetation successional change in forested types </li>
      <li class="listbullet">revisions to address discrepancies between map products and known field conditions </li>
      <li class="listbullet">specific systematic improvements</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">Canopy fuels (canopy base height, canopy bulk density, stand height and canopy cover) reflect areas with disturbance, i.e. a historical high severity wildfire should now have areas with very low canopy cover and a different fuel model.</p>
