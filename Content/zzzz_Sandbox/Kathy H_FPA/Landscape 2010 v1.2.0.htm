    <h1 class="heading1">Landscape 2010 v1.2.0</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Landfire 2010 v1.2.0 data for the continental United States, Alaska, and Hawaii were delivered in 2013. LANDFIRE (LF) 2010 was an update to LF2008 to more accurately represent current conditions and account for landscape disturbances that occurred in CY 2009 and 2010. Disturbances include: treatment activities such as wildland fire, fuel and vegetation treatments, mortality from insects and disease, storm damage, invasive plants, and other natural or anthropogenic events. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">LF 2010 used airborne and spaceborne lidar, and spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to map vegetation structure in areas where ground-based field information was lacking, including Alaska and U.S.-affiliated islands in the Caribbean and the Pacific.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">
      <span class="specialbold">Several enhancements were made to the existing vegetation type layer in LF 2010:</span>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Urban expansion was mapped using data from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 2006 land cover layer. </li>
      <li class="listbullet">Refinement of agricultural lands used the National Agricultural Statistics Service's Cropland Data Layer 2011. </li>
      <li class="listbullet">Wetland extents were enhanced using NLCD 2006 land cover and National Wetlands Inventory data. </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">If you are selecting the KBDI version of this data (Available only in they Southeastern U&gt;S&gt;), please click <a href="https://www.landfire.gov/documents/LF_DBFD_in_SE_US_Dec2015.pdf">here</a> for more information on how that layer is automatically adjusted for drought conditions.</p>
