    <h1 class="heading1">Landscan Overview</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">LandScan USA (known as LandScan) population is a nationally consistent raster dataset that depicts estimated residential (nighttime) population. The data are developed by fusing satellite remote sensing data, traditional geospatial infrastructure datasets, and US Bureau of Census demographic data. Each roughly 90m x 90m pixel has a nighttime population assigned to it. The population values are binned into 7 distinct classes for display. Pixels with no population are transparent. Population estimates reported in values inventories are the sum of the values of all pixels within the inventoried area (model output, planning area, wildfire polygon, etc). </p>
