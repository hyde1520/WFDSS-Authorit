    <p class="bodytext">HSIP Gold is a unified homeland infrastructure geospatial data inventory assembled by NGA in partnership with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for official use by the Homeland Security and Homeland Defense (HLS/HD) communities. It is a compilation of over 560 geospatial datasets characterizing domestic infrastructure and boundaries assembled from a variety of Federal agencies, commercial vendors, and State mission partners. Our most recent version of HSIP, in its entirety, is unclassified; it is subject to the handling and distribution rules for "Unclassified For Official Use Only" due to licensing and sharing restrictions set forth by the data source entities.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">For this reason, the data are not available for download within the WFDSS application or through the WFDSS data download page.</p>
