    <h1 class="heading1">Creating a Pending Decision</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">An Incident Owner or Editor can create a pending decision from the Objectives, Course of Action (COA) or Decision tabs.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">When you create a pending decision, you are creating the framework for your decision content. This must be done before you can review, approve, or publish a decision because this step provides formatting for the document. Only one pending decision can exist at any time, but you can create a pending decision anytime after the previous pending decision has been published.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">All decision inputs roll over into the formatted decision document and all subsequent decision inputs are also added to the structured document. After you create a pending decision, you can fine-tune the document, add supportive content, and finalize your inputs using the <a href="../5.3Release/About the Default Decision Editor.htm">default decision editor </a>or the <a href="../5.3Release/About the Advanced Decision Editor.htm">advanced decision editor</a>, available for selection on the Decisions page.</p>
