    <h1 class="heading1">Generating Hourly Weather Forecasts</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">You can derive 6 days of hourly weather forecast for an incident's latitude and longitude, or for any point you select on any map display in WFDSS. A local National Weather Service (NWS) Forecast Office provides the hourly forecast data, often referred to as point forecast data, for the 2.5km grid cell that contains the selected point. Inconsistency among point forecasts and associated elements may occur due to variation in forecast development and display among Forecast Offices.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Hourly weather forecasts become important when a fire's origin is at an elevation that varies significantly from the active portion of a fire, and when the fire is being modeled. In this case, hourly weather forecast data at the fire's origin would not reflect conditions on the actively burning portion of the fire, and a different more representative location (and grid cell) might provide more suitable forecast information. For example, if a fire's origin is at 7000' elevation and you are modeling fire behavior for an active portion of the fire at 9000', select a point on the map with an elevation around 9000'.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Contact your local NWS Forecast office you have questions regarding the hourly weather forecasts.</p>
