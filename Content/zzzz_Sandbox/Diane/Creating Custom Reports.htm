    <p class="bodytext">An incident owner or editor can create custom reports that are customized to meet the needs of the user.  You can create and publish custom reports that include a customized selection of active, inactive and/or yet to be published content.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Publishing your report locks the report's content and name and both become permanent.  Once a report is published, it can be downloaded and printed.  You will not be able to publish a report that contains content that has not yet been published in a decision, but you can download a draft .PDF for viewing and/or sharing.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Improvements to the Reports function are scheduled for future WFDSS releases in 2014.</p>
