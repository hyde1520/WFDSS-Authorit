    <p class="bodytext">The Contents and Index tabs provide two other methods for locating the help you need. The Contents function allows you to scroll through the list of help categories and the Index function allows you to scroll through a list of keywords to find related topics. If you can't find the information you are looking for in the Help, or the information is not clear, use the Feedback form to tell us what you were looking for and where you expected to find it.</p>
