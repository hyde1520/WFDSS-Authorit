    <h1 class="heading1">Including WFDSS-generated M.A.P. Images in a Decision</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Incident owners and editors can choose to include WFDSS-generated maps of individual or all M.A.P.s in a pending decision. The maps appear in the Course of Action portion of the decision, and can be reviewed in the pending decision before publishing. Maps are created using USGS topos as the base layer.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">If an incident is very large and/or has multiple M.A.Ps, a map displaying all M.A.Ps may be difficult to view and/or interpret. Maps of individual M.A.P.s may be more useful to incident managers and communicate crucial information more easily.  Incident owners and owners can also choose to <a href="../../User Documentation/01a_Common User Content/Map Features/Info tab/Capturing Map Images.htm">capture their own map images</a> that contain M.A.P.s.</p>
