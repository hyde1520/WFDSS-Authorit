    <p class="bodytext">GA Editors, National Editors, and users assigned the Feedback role can share and transfer individual incident, analysis, group, and intelligence filters to one or more users. A filter is shared from the Manage Filters perspective, and can be set as the default filter for the user you are sharing with.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">This option is helpful for new users having a hard time using filters. GA Editors, National Editors and/or users assigned the Helpdesk role can create an appropriate filter for the user and then share it directly with them, and other users as needed.</p>
