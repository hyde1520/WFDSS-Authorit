    <p class="bodytext">Each unit and agency has a set of Strategic Objectives and Management Requirements related to the landscape and its resources. These objectives and requirements guide decision-making for the unit, as well as incidents.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Pre-loading the Strategic Objectives and Management Requirements for an administrative unit into WFDSS helps to ensure that the incident managers are using this information as part of their incident decision-making process. Incident-level objectives and requirements should be based on these over-arching Strategic Objectives and Management Requirements.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Two types of planning processes are available for administrative units to use in WFDSS; Fire Management Unit (FMU) planning and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIzbB9dl_hc">Spatial Fire Planning (SFP)</a>. Depending on an administrative unit’s agency affiliation, one may be preferred or mandated over another. Data Managers can check with their Geographic Area Editor if they have questions.</p>
