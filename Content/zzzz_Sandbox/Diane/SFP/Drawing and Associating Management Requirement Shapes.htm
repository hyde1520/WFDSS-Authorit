    <h1 class="heading1">Drawing and Associating Management Requirement Shapes</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">WFDSS provides a robust set of tools that allow Data Managers to draw Management Requirement shapes on the Unit Map. Management Requirement shapes can be lines, rectangles or polygons and spatially represent associated Management Requirement text. The tools available to help Data Managers draw Management Requirement shapes on the Unit Map are the same tools used by fire managers and analysts to draw incident and analysis shapes on other map displays in WFDSS.</p>

    </p>
    <p class="bodytext">Data Managers can draw multi-part shapes to represent multiple areas to which a set of Management Requirement text will apply, or existing shapes can be merged to create a new shape. Polygons cannot be drawn with gaps in its interior (think of a donut), but users can upload this type of shape if needed.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Once a Management Requirement shape is drawn, it can be associated with one or more sets of Management Requirement text. If Management Requirement text has not yet been created, the shape can be associated at a later date. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">You can view shapes without assigned text on the Unit Map, and text is available for associating when you create, edit, or view Management Requirement text. The names of Management Requirement shapes not associated with text do not appear in the Strategic Objectives/Management Requirement list on the Data Management &gt; Objectives sub-tab.</p>
