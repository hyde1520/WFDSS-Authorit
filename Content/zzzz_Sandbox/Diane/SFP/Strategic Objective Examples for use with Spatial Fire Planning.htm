    <h1 class="heading1">Strategic Objective Examples for use with Spatial Fire Planning</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Language from each administrative unit’s Land, Resource, and/or Fire Management Plans varies. Most administrative units find that the direction from their Plans likely fits into one or more of these categories: </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Suppress fires at smallest size </li>
      <li class="listbullet">Suppress fires considering cost and or values at risk </li>
      <li class="listbullet">Manage fires for resource objectives</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Preplanned decision to monitor all fires for protection or restoration.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">For the examples above, each line would apply to an area on the landscape that would be represented in the spatial data. These are examples only; administrative units that choose to use the new SFP process can use their own exact language for their Strategic Objectives. The following additional examples illustrate that administrative units will likely have several categories of Strategic Objectives within their Land, Resource, and/or Fire Management Plans:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Manage 60% of natural starts for resource objectives.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Contain 90% of all unwanted wildland fires at less than 10 acres in size within 2 operational periods.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Manage fires for resource objectives when conditions and fire start location warrant.</li>
    </ul>
