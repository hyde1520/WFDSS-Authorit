    <h1 class="heading1">Guidelines for Developing Shapes used with the SFP Process</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">When developing Strategic Objectives and Management Requirements, data managers should not get hung up on terminology. What’s most important is that an administrative unit utilizes shapes and text that make sense, and clearly communicate NEPA-approved planning direction for the unit. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">When making this determination, use the following guidelines:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <p>With regards to Strategic Objective (SO) Shapes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="listbullet2">Determine which planning direction applies to the largest areas and lean towards using Strategic Objective shapes for those.</li>
          <li class="listbullet2">When developing SO Shapes, ensure that the individual shapes don't overlap</li>
          <li class="listbullet2">When developing SO Shapes, ensure that the entire unit is covered, as these shapes are used to create a Unit Boundary. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="listbullet">
        <p>With regards to Management Requirement (MR) Shapes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="listbullet2">Scattered, critical values or small areas of values can be represented by MR shapes, either single or multi-part. </li>
          <li class="listbullet2">The Unit Boundary is used to clip MR Shapes. This prevents units from adding requirements to neighboring units.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="listbullet">Create Other Unit Shapes for values or areas of concern that you don’t want appearing in the list of values for a unit.</li>
    </ul>
