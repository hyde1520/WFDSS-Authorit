    <h1 class="heading1">Developing a Spatial Fire Planning Transition Strategy for an Administrative Unit</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">The Data Manager needs to develop a transition strategy for their administrative unit that may include the following tasks:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Gains approval from leadership to change an administrative unit’s planning process from FMU to SFP.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Chooses to keep current FMU shapes or develop new SO shapes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">When you choose to keep your old FMU shape layer, the old FMU codes become SO codes and can’t be edited. To update the codes, the shape layer needs to be submitted to the WFDSS Data Team Contact who reloads the shape into WFDSS with new/updated SO codes in its attribute table.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">When new Strategic Objective shapes are required, prepare the Strategic Objective shape layer, associated codes, and then provide the spatial data to your agency's WFDSS Data Team Contact who:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Downloads the Excel spreadsheet of Management Requirements from the Data Management tab and save to a safe storage area.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Changes your administrative unit’s selection from FMU to SFP planning process on the Data Management tab.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Modifies existing Strategic Objective text or create new Strategic Objectives and associate each with the proper SO code.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Develops Management Requirements text and associated shapes.</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Learns about <a href="Other Unit Shapes.htm">Other Unit Shapes</a> and why they are useful for displaying content that an administrative unit may not want populated in a decision automatically.</li>
    </ul>
