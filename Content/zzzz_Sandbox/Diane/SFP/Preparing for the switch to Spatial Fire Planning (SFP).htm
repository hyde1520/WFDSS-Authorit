    <h1 class="heading1">Preparing for the switch to Spatial Fire Planning (SFP)</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Prior to switching to Spatial Fire Planning (SFP) , Data Managers must collect a variety of information to determine which data should be loaded into WFDSS as Strategic Objectives, Management Requirements and Other Unit Shapes. Data Managers must also determine how these data can be best represented spatially. Depending on an administrative unit’s agency affiliation, the uploaded data may serve as the unit’s spatial Fire Management Plan and this requires consideration. Data uploaded into WFDSS is viewed by other WFDSS users, as well as by incident management teams assigned to manage incidents in the area.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Before starting the upload process, you need the following information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">FMU or SO codes for your administrative unit and agency (FMU or SO codes must match the FMU or SO codes in the attributes of the spatial data layer; FMU codes can still be used if there is not a spatial FMU layer)</li>
      <li class="listbullet">General Management Plans</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Land Management Plans</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Resource Management Plans</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Fire Management Plans </li>
      <li class="listbullet">Local shapefiles frequently used in wildfire decisions</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">It is important to include this information so that fire managers have access to it as part of their decision-making process, and to ensure this information is included correctly in the system of record for an incident. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">WFDSS contains a wealth of spatial data to support administrative unit and associated planning documents, and can help fire managers identify resource values and concerns. You can review the data layer reference information for each of the available data layers to determine where the data came from and when. Data layers and associated reference information are updated frequently and represent the best available data.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Once the data is ready for upload into WFDSS, Data Managers need to decidde if they want to build their SFP process in Training or Production, as the planning process can be exported/imported from either system. </p>
