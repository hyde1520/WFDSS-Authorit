    <h1 class="heading1">Drawing Other Unit Shapes</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">WFDSS provides a robust set of tools that allow Data Managers to draw Other Unit shapes on the Unit Map. Since FMU and Strategic Objective shapes cannot be drawn (these are submitted to a WFDSS Data Contact for enabling), only Management Requirements and Other Unit Shapes can be drawn on the Unit Map (You can also <a href="Uploading Management Requirement Shapes.htm">upload Management Requirement</a> and <a href="Uploading Other Unit Shapes.htm">Other Unit Shapes</a> on the Unit Shapes sub-tab).</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Shapes that fall into the Other Unit shapes category can be lines, rectangles, or polygons that spatially represent information about local values data. The tools available to help Data Managers draw Other Unit Shapes on the Unit Map are the same tools used by fire managers and analysts to draw incident and analysis shapes on other map displays in WFDSS.</p>

    <p class="bodytext">Data Managers can draw multi-part shapes, or existing shapes can be merged to create a new shape. You cannot draw polygons with gaps in their interior (think of a donut), but you can upload this type of shape if needed.</p>
