    <h1 class="heading1">Other Unit Shapes</h1>
    <p class="bodytext">Other <a href="../../../User Documentation/Data Management/Unit Shapes.htm">Unit Shapes</a> are shapes other than <a href="../../4.7_Release/Strategic Objective Shapes.htm">Strategic Objective</a> and <a href="../../4.7_Release/Management Requirement Shapes.htm">Management Requirement shapes</a>, that help an administrative unit implement its chosen <a href="Planning Processes available in WFDSS.htm">Planning Process</a> in WFDSS and assist with incident management. Like Management Requirement shapes, Other Unit Shapes are managed at the administrative unit and contain information about local values. Unlike Management Requirement shapes, Other Unit Shapes do not require consideration in incident decision-making unless individual shapes are selected by the Data Manager to be included in the unit's values when the shape was created or uploaded. Once a Data Manager creates or uploads an Other Unit Shape, you cannot edit the the shape or its 'inclusion in values' status. A Data Manager will have to <a href="Uploading Other Unit Shapes.htm">upload</a> or <a href="Drawing Other Unit Shapes.htm">draw</a> a new shape and <a href="Deleting Other Unit Shapes.htm">delete</a> the old one.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">Other Unit shapes are points, lines, or polygons that contain information about local values data. Data Managers can <a href="Uploading Other Unit Shapes.htm">upload</a> these shapes as zipped shapefiles on the Unit Shapes sub tab or <a href="Drawing Other Unit Shapes.htm">draw</a> the shapes on the Unit Map. Other Unit Shapes can also be <a href="Viewing or Downloading Other Unit Shapes.htm">downloaded</a> from WFDSS for use in a GIS. Other Unit Shapes are not activated like Management Requirement shapes, and Data Managers have the flexibility to manage these types of shapes dynamically throughout the year. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">Data Managers can use the Unit Shapes feature to pre-load shapefiles and create a shapefile library of local values data for decision making on their unit. The shapefile library can save time when managing an incident by pre-loading shapes that relate to local conditions and the unit's fire planning process. The shapefile library ensures that relevant Unit Shapes are available and considered in the decision-making process. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">Examples of values that can be saved as Other Unit Shapes include, but are not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="listbullet">Values layers specific to local fire decisions</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Threatened and endangered species</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Prescribed burn and fuels treatment areas</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Barriers</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Management Action Points</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Structures</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Campgrounds</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Trails</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Mine shafts and other hazards</li>
      <li class="listbullet">Private property</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="bodytext">What’s unique about Other Unit Shapes is that a Data Manager can choose to include the value a shape represents in the list of values for an administrative unit. If the Data Manager chooses to include the shape in the list of values, then the value is considered in an incident’s decision content when the shape intersects the incident’s planning area.</p>
    <p class="bodytext">You can copy Other Unit Shapes and save them for use as incident or analysis shapes. For example, if an administrative unit frequently uses the same M.A.P.s each year, these shapes can be loaded into WFDSS as Other Unit Shapes. The shapes can be copied, saved and reused each year without having to redraw or re-upload. </p>
    <p class="bodytext">Before uploading Other Unit Shapes for a unit, your unit's FMUs or Strategic Objective shapes must already exist in the national FMU layer. Contact the <a href="">WFDSS GIS Team</a> for assistance.</p>
    <p class="warning">
      <span class="specialbold">WARNING</span>: Before uploading or drawing Other Unit Shapes, a Data Manager must ensure that the shape does not exceed the maximum shape size (100 points or 50000 vertices for lines and polygons), and determine if the value the shape represents should be included in an administrative unit's Values for consideration in incident decision-making. Once created, an Other Unit Shape cannot be edited, nor can a Data Manager choose to select or deselect the <span class="specialbold">Include in Values</span> option. A new shape with updated attributes needs to be uploaded or created and the old shape deleted.</p>
